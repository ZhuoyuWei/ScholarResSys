{"about_the_course":"Statistics is a thriving discipline that provides the fundamental language\nof all empirical research. Biostatistics is simply the field of statistics\napplied in the biomedical sciences.\n<br>\n<br>This course puts forward key mathematical and statistical topics to help\nstudents understand biostatistics at a deeper level. After completing this\ncourse, students will have a basic level of understanding of the goals,\nassumptions, benefits and negatives of probability modeling in the medical\nsciences. This understanding will be invaluable when approaching new statistical\ntopics and will provide students with a framework and foundation for future\nself learning.\n<br>\n<br>Topics include probability, random variables, distributions, expectations,\nvariances, independence, conditional probabilities, likelihood and some\nbasic inferences based on confidence intervals.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/eb/cf8c0e7e0bb418255e48fe210446c1/bootcamp_B-02.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cd/3cc4db194a8f70139ec63afd200a0f/bootcamp_B-02.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/99/b022103b7d744911d090acafe2cb98/bootcamp_B-02.jpg","video":"ekdpaf_WT_8","university-ids":["jhu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/ekdpaf_WT_8/","id":68,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/0fb2d85007ca7f6d671b73e64a44d6/nursing.logo.large.horizontal.blue.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"JohnsHopkins","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico","website_facebook":"johnshopkinsuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png","background_color":"","id":8,"location_city":"Baltimore","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.29038480000000000,"location":"Baltimore, MD","primary_color":"#0061AA","abbr_name":"Johns Hopkins","website":"http://www.jhu.edu/","description":"The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.","short_name":"jhu","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"johnshopkins","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg","location_state":"MD","name":"Johns Hopkins University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/229e9cabab40da92cdd0fc46cd7e06/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/4b4ca39464d8fd3a75bf8a68d0a1d9/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-76.61218930000001000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"This class presents the fundamental probability and statistical concepts used in elementary data analysis.
