{"ItemName":"Maps and the Geospatial Revolution","Major":"Information, Tech & Design Statistics and Data Analysis Social Sciences ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/maps","Content":"The past decade has seen an explosion of new mechanisms for understanding and using location information in widely-accessible technologies. This Geospatial Revolution has resulted in the development of consumer GPS tools, interactive web maps, and location-aware mobile devices. These radical advances are making it possible for people from all walks of life to use, collect, and understand spatial information like never before.<br>&nbsp;<br>This course brings together core concepts in cartography, geographic information systems, and spatial thinking with real-world examples to provide the fundamentals necessary to engage with Geography beyond the surface-level. We will explore what makes spatial information special, how spatial data is created, how spatial analysis is conducted, and how to design maps so that theyâ€™re effective at telling the stories we wish to share. To gain experience using this knowledge, we will work with the latest mapping and analysis software to explore geographic problems.&nbsp;","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/67/675cb1af3e868d0b5463bdf5c694e4/MapsGR_Logo.jpg","Short_des":"Learn how advances in geospatial technology and analytical methods have changed how we do everything, and discover how to make maps and analyze geographic patterns using the latest tools.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Anthony C.
