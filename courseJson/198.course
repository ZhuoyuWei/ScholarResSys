It is&nbsp;estimated that there are currently over&nbsp;1 billion transistors per human being in the world. Part of the MOS transistor's success lies in its very small size (you can fit 1,000 of them within the <i>width</i> of a human hair!), part lies on some amazing things this device&nbsp;can do. However, the descriptions of MOS transistors in basic electronics courses cannot begin to do&nbsp;justice to this device.&nbsp;If you want to really know how the MOSFET&nbsp;operates, and how to model it, you need to study it carefully and systematically. This course will help you do just that.&nbsp;<br>
<br>The course starts with a review of basic physical principles, and expands into a detailed treatment of MOS transistor phenomena, in a logical and systematic fashion, enhanced by intuitive discussions. We discuss a hierarchy of models - from the simple to the sophisticated - clearly identifying the connections between them, and encompassing many aspects of modeling, including dc, large-signal transient operation, quasi-static operation, non-quasi-static operation, small-signal operation,&nbsp;noise, and structural effects. We discuss the concepts on which&nbsp;the most popular CAD (computer-aided design) MOS transistor models are based.<br><br>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/33/a89e4f7802ee99b6a3ce57a0a89bd4/Logo1large_b.gif","Short_des":"Learn how MOS transistors work, and how to model them. The understanding provided in this course is essential not only for device modelers, but also for designers of high-performance circuits.
