{"ItemName":"Science, Technology, and Society in China II: History of S&amp;T in Chinese Society","Major":"Social Sciences ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/stschina2","Content":"Having mastered in general terms some of the key concepts used in understanding
the relationship between science/technology and society, this course begins
to apply those concepts to China, historically and chronologically. Concepts
such as path dependency/lock-in effect, technological determinism and others
will be used to frame a narrative describing the emergence of science and
technology in Chinese society. This narrative will be heavily informed
by developments in the West during the Industrial Revolution so that we
can understand how that series of events affected the development of science
and technology in China. This part of the course will also lay the foundation
for <b><u><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/stschina3">Part III</a></u></b>.","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6f/ddb97a22d4abc7670fa84143cf30c5/stschina2-course-logo.jpg","Short_des":"This course is the second in a trilogy of short courses. In this part, we apply some of the concepts we covered in Part I to study the development of science and technology in Chinese society, particularly in light of the influence the Industrial Revolution in the West has had on Chinaâ€™s technological development.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Naubahar Sharif"}]}
