{"ItemName":"Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering","Major":"Engineering ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/eefun","Content":"<div>The course focuses on the creation, manipulation, transmission, and reception of information by electronic means. The topics covered include elementary signal theory; time- and frequency-domain analysis of signals; conversion of analog signals to a digital form; and how information can be represented with signals. Signal processing, both analog and digital, allow information to be extracted and manipulated. The course then turns to information theory, which demonstrates the technological advantages of digital transmission.</div>
