{"ItemName":"Clinical Terminology for International and U.S. Students","Major":"Medicine ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/clinicalterminology","Content":"<p>The language of health care providers at U.S. clinical sites is heavily infused with abbreviations and technical terms. Frequently, there is little time to ask for explanations. This course focuses on terms and abbreviations that will be heard or seen
    during early clinical work. Terms are presented according to the clinical context in which they will be experienced using print, audio and visual representations. A web-based clinical dictionary for beginners provides additional information about
    terms presented in the course as well as definitions of many important terms that could not be covered in the six week course.</p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/45/2edd6df91e4f29d01650d815e0f2f6/MP900433088.JPG","Short_des":"Understanding the clinical terms and abbreviations commonly used in U.S. hospitals is challenging. Adaptation to clinical language is difficult for U.S. students entering the clinical area and even more difficult for international students whose primary language is not English. This course helps both groups of students understand many of the terms and abbreviations commonly encountered during the first three months of clinical work on a U.S. general hospital unit.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Valerie Swigart"},{"author":"Michael Gold"}]}
