a fair bit of time working through the unique traits of oral versus written
communication in order to help students prepare speeches that are easier
to deliver orally and understand aurally. The class’s focus on understanding
the key parts of an argument and drafting clear and concise arguments translates
directly to other academic assignments. In service of this goal, we will
study the principles of argumentation and arrangement; critically examine
our own speeches and the speeches of others. By becoming a student of public
speaking, you join a long history of rhetorical study dating back to ancient
Greece.&nbsp;","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b9/6600483a7588998627ea34d3c8dee8/Public-Speaking.jpg","Short_des":"A report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows that employers want job candidates with strong communication skills.
