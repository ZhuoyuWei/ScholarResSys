{"ItemName":"Financial Engineering and Risk Management Part II","Major":"Economics & Finance Statistics and Data Analysis ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/fe2","Content":"Financial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving finance and economics, mathematics, statistics, engineering and&nbsp;computational methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis of <b>FE &amp; RM&nbsp;Part II</b>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;on the use of&nbsp;simple stochastic models to (i) solve portfolio optimization problems &nbsp;(ii) price derivative securities in various asset classes&nbsp;including equities and credit and (iii) consider some advanced applications of financial engineering including algorithmic trading and the pricing of real options. We will also consider the role that financial engineering played during the financial crisis.&nbsp;<br><br>We hope that students who complete the course and the prerequisite course (<b>FE &amp; RM Part I</b>) will have a good understanding of the "rocket science" behind financial engineering. But perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree of&nbsp;skepticism. &nbsp;","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9e/a657541839dd8d5565a06864121213/stocksii.jpg","Short_des":"This course follows on from FE & RM Part I. We will consider portfolio optimization, risk management and some advanced examples of derivatives pricing that draw from structured credit, real options and energy derivatives. We will also cast a critical eye on how financial models are used in practice.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Martin Haugh"},{"author":"Garud Iyengar"}]}
