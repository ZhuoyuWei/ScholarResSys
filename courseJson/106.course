{"ItemName":"Statistical Analysis of fMRI Data","Major":"Medicine Mathematics Health & Society ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/fmri","Content":"In this course we will explore the intersection of statistics and&nbsp;functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, which is a&nbsp;non-invasive technique for studying brain activity. We will discuss&nbsp;the analysis of fMRI data, from its acquisition to its use in locating&nbsp;brain activity, making inference about brain connectivity and&nbsp;predictions about psychological or disease states. A standard fMRI&nbsp;study gives rise to massive amounts of noisy data with a complicated&nbsp;spatio-temporal correlation structure. Statistics plays a crucial role&nbsp;in understanding the nature of the data and obtaining relevant results&nbsp;that can be used and interpreted by neuroscientists.","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/99/e7cc1626344d9b8f671a81a7d12acb/fMRI-02.jpg","Short_des":"Explore the intersection of statistics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a non-invasive technique for studying brain activity.
