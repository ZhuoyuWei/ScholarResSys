Video games are the dominant entertainment form of our time because they are powerful tools for motivating behavior.
    Effective games leverage both psychology and technology, in ways that can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves. Gamification as a business practice has exploded over the past two years. Organizations are applying it in
    areas such as marketing, human resources, productivity enhancement, sustainability, training, health and wellness, innovation, and customer engagement. Game thinking means more than just dropping in badges and leaderboards; it requires a thoughtful
    understanding of motivation and design techniques. This course examines the mechanisms of gamification and provides an understanding of its effective use.
