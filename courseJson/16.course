No prior programming knowledge is necessary. In this course you'll have fun learning to create an app for modern Android devices such as the Nexus tablet. <br><br>You'll use the programming tools that Android software developers use and build a complete and useful app during this course. Along the way, we'll introduce fundamental computer science principles and programming ideas that power today’s smart-phone and tablet apps. <br><br>A reasonably modern and powerful Linux, Windows or Mac-OSX computer is required. A modern Android tablet or phone (such as the approximately USD$199 Nexus 7)  is useful but not-required because you’ll be able to use a virtual device that runs on your computer.","ImageUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/androidapps101/large-icon.png","Short_des":"This course introduces the fundamental computer science principles that power today’s apps.
