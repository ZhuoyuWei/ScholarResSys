prediction. Skills required for data analytics at massive levels – scalable
data management on and off the cloud, parallel algorithms, statistical
modeling, and proficiency with a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms
– span a variety of disciplines and are not easy to obtain through conventional
curricula. Tour the basic techniques of data science, including both SQL
and NoSQL solutions for massive data management (e.g., MapReduce and contemporaries),
algorithms for data mining (e.g., clustering and association rule mining),
and basic statistical modeling (e.g., linear and non-linear regression).<br>","ImageUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/datasci/large-icon.png","Short_des":"Join the data revolution. Companies are searching for data scientists. This specialized field demands multiple skills not easy to obtain through conventional curricula. Introduce yourself to the basics of data science and leave armed with practical experience extracting value from big data.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Bill Howe"}]}
