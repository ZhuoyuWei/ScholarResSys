of the distribution and determinants of health conditions or events among
populations and the application of that study to control health problems.
By applying the concepts learned in this course to current public health
problems and issues, students will&nbsp; understand the practice of epidemiology
as it relates to real life and makes for a better appreciation of public
health programs and policies. This course explores &nbsp;public health
issues like obesity and infectious diseases – both locally and globally
–through the lens of epidemiology.
