{"ItemName":"Structure Standing Still: The Statics of Everyday Objects","Major":"Engineering ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/staticsofobjects","Content":"<p>The Statics of Everyday Objects is a course about the world and
how it reacts to the forces acting on it. From suspension bridges holding up
miles of roadway, to sky-scraping buildings in the midst hurricanes, to huge
dams retaining billions of gallons of water in a reservoir, these structures
must withstand both the forces of nature and the forces that mankind has
intended for them. The analytical tools that designers use to create these
structures are deceptively simple, and it is the intent of this course to
explain things in a clear, straightforward manner.</p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/dd/88b3b8ef600c0e20afcf2043b29a67/Structure-Standing-Still.jpg","Short_des":"The Statics of Everyday Objects is a course about how structures react to forces exerted on them while remaining unmoved.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Dan Dickrell"}]}
