{"ItemName":"Mechanics: Motion, Forces, Energy and Gravity, from Particles to Planets","Major":"Physics ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/particles2planets","Content":"<p>Most of the phenomena in the world around you are, at the fundamental level, based on physics, and much of physics is based on mechanics. You will understand with greater depth many of the wonders around you in everyday life, in technology, in the universe at large. That, in turn, will lead you to look further and deeper into the world and the universe around you. Meanwhile, we think you'll have some fun, too.<br></p><p>
This course uses rich multimedia
 tutorials to present the material: film clips of key experiments, 
animations and worked example problems, all with a friendly narrator. 
You'll then do a range of interesting problems to
 practise what you've learnt, and for assessment. You will use your 
ingenuity to come up with two experimental investigations using simple, 
everyday materials (plus a computer).Â </p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/55/35f952437dbd605ae15481198aacc5/Unknown.jpeg","Short_des":"Mechanics is the basis of much of physics, engineering and other technological disciplines. It begins by quantifying motion, and then explaining it in terms of forces, energy, momentum and forces including gravity. This allows us to analyse the operation of many familiar phenomena around us, but also the mechanics of planets, stars and galaxies.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Joe Wolfe"},{"author":"Elizabeth  J.
