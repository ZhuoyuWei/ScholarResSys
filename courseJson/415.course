{"ItemName":"Introductory Organic Chemistry - Part 2","Major":"Chemistry ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/orgchem1b","Content":"<div>This course surveys the reactions of organic compounds with an emphasis on mechanisms and a structure-based approach to understanding reactivity. &nbsp;Concepts and models are developed to build intuition about the reactivity of organic compounds. These concepts will prepare students for a mechanistic-based approach to learning organic reactivity. Emphasis will also be placed on developing problem-solving skills unique to organic chemistry. This course, orgchem1b, together with its prerequisite, orgchem1a are equivalent to a first-semester organic chemistry course; these courses and the subsequent courses (orgchem2a and orgchem2b) are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.</div>","ImageUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/orgchem1b/large-icon.png","Short_des":"Organic chemistry course surveying introductory topics in structure and reactivity with an emphasis on elementary reaction mechanisms.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Jeffrey S.
