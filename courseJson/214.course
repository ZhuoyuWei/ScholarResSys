{"ItemName":"The Science of Safety in Healthcare","Major":"Medicine Health & Society ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/healthcaresafety","Content":"This course will introduce the basic principles of the science and culture of safety in healthcare. The goals for this course are to provide definitions and context of patient safety concepts and terms using a systems approach. We will explore foundation-level content in the science of safety, patient safety culture, teamwork, patient-centered care, and leading change. Students will also be introduced to strategies for identifying and mitigating risks through the use of human factors science and quality improvement methods. They will learn about the importance of using data to guide their change efforts, and about the use of the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) as one model to engage care teams—and entire organizations—in the effort to reduce preventable harm to patients. While course content and examples will focus on the acute-care healthcare setting, specifically the hospital, learning will be relevant to other healthcare settings such as extended care, outpatient, and home care settings. The content of this course has been adapted from the intensive five-day Patient Safety Certificate Program offered by the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality as well as the Helene Fuld Fellows Program undergraduate course content from the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/68/d3acfc68c486786054e0976afbc11e/healthcare_safety.jpg","Short_des":"This course will introduce the basic principles of the science of safety in healthcare.
