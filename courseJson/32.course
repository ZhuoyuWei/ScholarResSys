{"ItemName":"Critical Perspectives on Management","Major":"Business & Management ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/criticalmanagement","Content":"<p>This course is designed for students of all backgrounds who have an interest in how firms are governed, the forces that have helped define modern management practice, and the outcomes of that practice not only for the firm itself, but also for the societies in which they operate. For students who are thinking of a career in management, it may also prove useful as a basic introduction to some of the conceptual vocabulary and ideas behind modern theories of management. </p><p>Using a wide disciplinary approach - from economics and history to social theory and even a smattering of biblical criticism - the course will invite students to consider several core management strategies and priorities from often unexpected perspectives in order to judge their success or failure. The key objective of the course is to bring into critical focus how
we think about the function and culture of management, how managers understand their role within a firm, how they take
decisions, set priorities and benchmark success and failure. </p>Topics include: the
function of the firm; the role of incentive; the ways in which narrative forces shape decision making, and how market relationships define the
managerial culture in ways that can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.<br>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fb/964f4a920bbe78366bf9717388cf0f/escher_video.jpg","Short_des":"An unconventional approach to management strategy! This class offers students the opportunity to explore today's management practices from unexpected perspectives in order to ask provocative questions about the modern business environment. This approach will allow us to interrogate key management concepts in order to explore the thinking that informs them and, as importantly, the form of capitalism they foster.
