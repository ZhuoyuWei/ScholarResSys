{"ItemName":"International Organizational Behavior and Leadership","Major":"Business & Management Social Sciences ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/intorb","Content":"All of us work with other people in organizations. You may be a budding entrepreneur working with a business partner in the proverbial start-up garage, or as chef with kitchen and serving staff in a three star restaurant. You may be part of a globally dispersed team of engineers collaborating virtually on a new aircraft, a member of an online community collectively compiling a web encyclopedia, or a volunteer involved with a network of development aid workers supporting a community hit by humanitarian crisis. The success of any organization we are engaged in – especially when it brings together individuals from across borders and cultures – ultimately depends on how well we understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors. <br><br>All of us can contribute to improving the organizations we work in, and social science research can provide us with the tools to do so. Insights from psychologists, neuroscientists, sociologists and anthropologists, from communication scholars and from management scholars allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. In addition, social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders.<br><br>Learning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?<br><br>We are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and self-discovery. <p></p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/62/58d990f18cd48083251c3e57fe9e7e/Untitled-1.jpg","Short_des":"Learn to better understand and manage cognition, emotion and behavior of people in organizations across different cultural contexts.
