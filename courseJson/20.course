The areas of focus include calculus and&nbsp;multivariable calculus, constrained and unconstrained
optimization, and linear algebra.
<br>

<p>Topics covered include the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Functions and inverse functions</li>
    <li>Limits, derivatives, partial derivatives, and chain rule
    </li>
    <li>Integrals and multiple integrals, changing the order of differentiation and integration</li>
    <li>Taylor series approximations</li>
    <li>Newtonâ€™s method</li>
    <li>Lagrange multiplier method</li>
    <li>Vector and matrix arithmetic, determinants, eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition,&nbsp;singular value decomposition</li>
    <li>Numerical methods for optimization
        <br>
    </li>
</ul><b><u>Course goal</u>:</b><span><br>
Upon completion of the course students will know the fundamental mathematical
concepts&nbsp;needed to effectively study quantitative finance areas such as
fixed income, options and&nbsp;derivatives, portfolio optimization,
and&nbsp;quantitative risk management.</span><b><u><br><br>Course Objectives</u></b>:
<br>
<p>
    Upon completion of the course students will:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Understand the concept of a limit, differentiation, and integration;</li>
    <li>Be able to compute partial derivatives and multiple integrals;</li>
    <li>Understand the utility of matrix decompositions;</li>
