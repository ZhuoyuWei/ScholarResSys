{"ItemName":"Digital Signal Processing","Major":"Mathematics Engineering Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/dsp","Content":"The goal of the course is to develop a complete working set of digital signal processing notions from the ground up. DSP is arguably at the heart of the “digital revolution” that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability. <br><br> In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.","ImageUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/dsp/large-icon.png","Short_des":"Learn the fundamentals of digital signal processing theory and discover the myriad ways DSP makes everyday life more productive and fun.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Paolo Prandoni"},{"author":"Martin Vetterli"}]}
