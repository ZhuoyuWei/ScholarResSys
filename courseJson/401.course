since World War II.&nbsp; How are governments
responding?&nbsp; Could they do more?&nbsp; These are the questions that will be tackled
in this course.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The course begins with a review of some basic
macroeconomic concepts to lay the groundwork for the policy framework.&nbsp; It then analyzes how fiscal policy works and
what the effects of todayÂ´s outsized deficits and debts could be on national
economies.&nbsp; It then moves to monetary
policy and explores its drawbacks and the recourse to other approaches, such as
quantitative easing.&nbsp; Finally, the course
looks at the other policies open to governments to address a crisis, and the
debate over how they have been used today.</p>

Students will finish
the course by trying their own hands at economic policymaking for an
unidentified country, with an online simulator exercise.<br><br><br>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3f/f561bfe742b0e20993a7b0e608f523/5course_logo.jpg","Short_des":"This course will take a non-technical approach to understanding how governments influence the macroeconomy.
