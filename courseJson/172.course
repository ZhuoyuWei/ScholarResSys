And how can we specify what the circuit is meant to do so we could check that this design does what we want?</li></ul>These are questions about <i>Logic</i>. When you learn logic you'll learn to recognise patterns of information and the way it can be represented. These skills are used whether we're dealing with theories, databases, digital circuits, meaning in language, or mathematical reasoning, and they will be used in the future in ways we haven't yet imagined. Learning logic is a central part of learning to think well, and this course will help you learn logic and how you can apply it.<br><br>This subject follows from <i><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/logic1" target="_blank" title="Link: https://www.coursera.org/course/logic1">Logic</a></i><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/logic1" target="_blank">: </a><i><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/logic1" target="_blank" title="Link: https://www.coursera.org/course/logic1">Language and Information 1</a></i>, to cover core techniques in first order predicate logic: the idea of formal languages with quantifiers, which gives us a way to talk about more logical structure than in propositional logic; and we will cover the central logical concepts such as consistency and validity; models; and proofs in predicate logic. But you won’t only learn these concepts and tools. We will also explore how these techniques connect with issues in <i>linguistics</i>, <i>computer science</i>, <i>electronic engineering</i>, <i>mathematics</i>, and <i>philosophy</i>.","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/32/6b5057fdb57c2f816c235a79baf0e1/Orange_logic2.png","Short_des":"This is an introduction to predicate logic and how it is applied in computer science, electronic engineering, linguistics, mathematics and philosophy. Building on your knowledge of propositional logic, you will learn predicate logic—its language, interpretations and proofs, and apply it to solve problems in a wide range of disciplines.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Greg Restall"},{"author":"Jen Davoren"}]}
