{"ItemName":"Creating Site-Specific Dance and Performance Works","Major":"Arts ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/sitedance","Content":"<p>This course will look into the process of creating live site-specific choreography and performance works from conception, production to performance. Site-specific dance/performance is work created in response to a particular place or site, and is inspired by its architecture/design,
    the history and/or current use. We will investigate&nbsp;urban, architectural and environmental inspired site projects ranging from large-scale to small (guerrilla) style productions. We will&nbsp;delineate definitions of site-specificity, and&nbsp;look
    across the history of the field, focusing primarily on dance.</p>
<p>Specific techniques and approaches towards generating site-inspired choreography, developed over the last 25 years by site artist Stephan Koplowitz will be introduced. Aspects of navigating technical issues (lighting, sound, media) and a primer
    on producing (budgeting, obtaining permissions, insurance, fundraising, audience/event design) will also be covered.
