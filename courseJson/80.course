few of us pause to think about the larger questions of money, politics,
race, sex, culture, and commercialization that surround sports everywhere. This course draws on the tools of anthropology, sociology, history,
and other disciplines to give you new perspectives on the games we watch
and play. We will focus on both popular sports like soccer (or “football,”
as anyone outside America calls it), basketball, and baseball, and also
lesser-known ones like mountain-climbing and fishing. Special guests
will include former major league baseball player and ESPN commentator
