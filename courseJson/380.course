{"ItemName":"Introduction to Tissue Engineering","Major":"Biology & Life Sciences Engineering ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/tissue101","Content":"<p>Tissue Engineering is a rapidly expanding field of applied biology and
    biomedical engineering that aims to create artificial organs for transplantation,
    basic research, or drug development. A fascinating aspect of the field
    is the fundamental need to integrate knowledge of organic chemistry, cell
    biology, genetics, mechanics and transport processes to create functional
    organs. The process uncovers the fascinating complexity of living tissues,
    and the joy of creation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This course will review basic cell culture techniques, structure function
    relationships, cellular communication, natural and artificial biomaterials,
    and the basic equations governing cell survival and tissue organization.&nbsp;</p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/eb/2d881eb445e26bf0faa2c5f38626a3/husinusoid.png","Short_des":"Step into the world of Tissue Engineering, a rapidly expanding field of applied biology aiming to create artificial organs for transplantation, basic research, or drug development.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Yaakov Nahmias"}]}
