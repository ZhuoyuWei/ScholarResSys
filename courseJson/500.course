This course will examine and explain the business of sports by analyzing the economic, legal, governance and success models in various sports industries. The primary
    focus will be on American team sports but comparative global models will be contemplated as well.&nbsp; We will seek to find the answers to questions such as: what lessons can global sports entities learn from each other? What business strategies
    are used to retain the profitability of world leagues, sports teams and franchises? What lessons can be drawn from the United States based sports models? What revised models should new entrepreneurial leagues apply in order to achieve success? Substantive
    instruction will be drawn from the likes of the Olympics, FIFA World Cup, MLB, NFL, Premier League, various player unions, China, India, South Africa, Brazil and much more. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, our goal is to equip the student with a framework
    and tools with which to understand and evaluate the business side of a wide range of competitive sports ventures.</p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0b/d85a09701d7ab5e83938f9ca44fbf5/GBS.jpg","Short_des":"This course analyzes the business side of sports and discusses the intricacies of global sports leagues as well as various countries' sports strategies.
