{"ItemName":"Introduction to Computational Arts","Major":"Computer Science: Theory Information, Tech & Design Music, Film, and Audio Arts ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/cdt208","Content":"<span><p>In this 16-week course we’ll introduce the fundamentals of computational arts–covering basic programming, simple image processing and elementary sound recording. This class has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing. </p><p>For programming we’ll be using the free and open source programming language and integrated development environment, Processing. The course will provide the essentials of programming in a visual context, allowing you to visualize, design, and create generative art with Processing.</p><p>For visuals we’ll cover Photoshop CS5 and GIMP, which is a free open-source tool offering the same functionality as Photoshop. Whether you have access to one or the other, you will learn how to create and manipulate digital images, and most importantly, you will become comfortable enough to expand on what you learn here, after the end of our course.</p><p>For sound we’ll teach both Logic and Soundation. Logic is Apple’s DAW or Digital Audio Workstation while Soundation is a free web-based multi-track audio editor. We’ll be teaching the basics of digital audio–including recording, and automating effects. </p><p>You will complete both technical assignments and artistic projects, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. We’ll cover the history of sound and art in the Twentieth and 21st Centuries to give context for your artistic endeavors.</p><p>Peer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 15 weeks you should have a strong foundation for how computers work and deal with data, specifically how image and sound are represented by the computer.</p><p>Additionally, you’ll create an online portfolio of digital art projects, and be able to communicate ideas about art. &nbsp;</p><p>Each week you’ll watch two video series - one on the theory and one on the practice. There will be technical assignments and artistic projects which will be peer reviewed. We’re looking forward to working with you. </p><div><br></div></span>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b7/b6e0e72268b561250e9068a642ae98/YSkFtIC---Imgur.png","Short_des":"This multidisciplinary production class serves as an introduction to, and exploration of electronic media in the arts.
