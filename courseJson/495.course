{"ItemName":"Introduction to Systems Engineering","Major":"Information, Tech & Design Business & Management Engineering ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/introse","Content":"Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary approach to design, implementation and evaluation that holds the key to the successful development of complex human-made systems. This course explores a framework encapsulating the entire systems engineering discipline, clearly showing where the multitude of associated activities fits within the overall effort and how the activities relate to one another.Â  Systems engineering is a very broad discipline, so we also discuss how the concepts and procedures could be applied to individual projects. A new theme will be explored each week using presentations to introduce and synthesise key concepts, examples to simulate authentic contexts, and structured activities to guide your learning. <br><br>The course is relevant to all professions associated with the introduction of complex human-made systems: project managers, engineers, quality assurance representatives, integrated logistic support practitioners, operators, managers, maintainers, and so on, from students to professionals, from novices to experienced practitioners, from technical to non-technical people. <br><br>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/18/0ae606afb5f38a243b006c4bf4addd/iStock_000004538031Small.jpg","Short_des":"Learn how the discipline of systems engineering can lead to the successful development of complex systems.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Mike J.
