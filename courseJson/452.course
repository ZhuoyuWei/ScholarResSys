Linear algebra in turn is built on two basic elements, the matrix and the vector.  </div><div><br></div><div>In this class, you will learn the concepts and methods of  linear algebra, and how to use them to think about problems arising in computer science.  You will write small programs in the programming language Python to  implement basic matrix and vector functionality and algorithms, and use these to process real-world data to achieve such tasks as: two-dimensional graphics transformations, face morphing, face detection, image transformations such as blurring and edge detection, image perspective removal, audio and image compression, searching within an image or an audio clip, classification of tumors as malignant or  benign, integer factorization, error-correcting codes, secret-sharing, network layout, document classification, and computing Pagerank (Google's ranking method).</div><div><br></div>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/6faacf42b19cf2772061ae095d98ee/460_259_logo.jpg","Short_des":"Learn the concepts and methods of linear algebra, and how to use them to think about computational problems arising in computer science.
