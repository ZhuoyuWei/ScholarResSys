{"ItemName":"Web Intelligence and Big Data","Major":"Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata","Content":"The past decade has witnessed the successful of application of many AI techniques used at `web-scaleâ€™, on what are popularly referred to as big data platforms based on the map-reduce parallel computing paradigm and associated technologies such as distributed file systems, no-SQL databases and stream computing engines. Online advertising, machine translation, natural language understanding, sentiment mining, personalized medicine, and national security are some examples of such AI-based web-intelligence applications that are already in the public eye. Others, though less apparent, impact the operations of large enterprises from sales and marketing to manufacturing and supply chains. In this course we explore some such applications, the AI/statistical techniques that make them possible, along with parallel implementations using map-reduce and related platforms.","ImageUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/bigdata/large-icon.png","Short_des":"This course is about building 'web-intelligence' applications exploiting big data sources arising social media, mobile devices and sensors, using new big-data platforms based on the 'map-reduce' parallel programming paradigm. During the fall semester this course is offered at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi as well as the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi.
