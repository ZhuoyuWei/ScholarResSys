{"ItemName":"C++ For C Programmers","Major":"Computer Science: Software Engineering ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/cplusplus4c","Content":"The course provides an overview of C++ for the experienced C programmer. You will learn how C++ is more powerful than C. The C++ STL library will be featured. This library allows C++ programmers to code generically, efficiently and at a high level. You will learn how to write basic graph algorithms such as the shortest path algorithm. You'll then put this skill to use in a programming assignment aimed at producing an intelligent hex player.<br>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5a/9714c78f48e904da8812795fe243c9/Cplusplus_pic.jpg","Short_des":"This course is for experienced C programmers who want to program in C++. The examples and exercises require a basic understanding of algorithms and object-oriented software.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Ira Pohl"}]}
