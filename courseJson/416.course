{"ItemName":"Introductory Organic Chemistry - Part 1","Major":"Chemistry ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/orgchem1a","Content":"This course surveys structural chemistry of organic compounds with an emphasis on electronic structure, conformation and stereochemistry. Concepts and models are developed to build intuition about the stability and reactivity of organic compounds. These concepts will prepare students for a mechanistic-based approach to learning organic reactivity. Emphasis will also be placed on developing problem-solving skills unique to organic chemistry. This course (Introductory Organic Chemistry Part I)&nbsp;together with Introductory Organic Chemistry Part II&nbsp;are equivalent to a first-semester organic chemistry course; these courses and the subsequent courses (Intermediate Organic Chemistry Parts I and II) are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as pre-medical, pre-dental, and pre-veterinary programs.","ImageUrl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/orgchem1a/large-icon.png","Short_des":"This is a organic chemistry course surveying introductory topics in structure and reactivity with an emphasis on structural fundamentals including electronic structure, conformation and stereochemistry.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Jeffrey S.
