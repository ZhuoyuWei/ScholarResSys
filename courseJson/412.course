observers inside and outside China have come to regard the country as a
“technological superpower”, and analyze the extent to which this reflects
the actual situation today (and tomorrow).","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/46/5870abe21eaca3cac9a96ea18d885a/stschina3-course-logo.jpg","Short_des":"This course is the third in a trilogy of short courses.
