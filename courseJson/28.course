vision applications, such as object detection in natural images and automatic
segmentation of medical acquisitions, rely on models that interpret the visual
information provided to a computer. The model provides a compromise between the
support given by the observations and the prior domain knowledge. This course
is concerned with the two computational problems that arise when using such models
in practice.</p>

<p><i>Inference
(Energy Minimization):</i></p>

<p>Given a visual observation (for example, an image or an MRI scan), we
are interested in estimating its most likely interpretation (i.e. the location of all
the objects in the image, or the segments of the MRI scan) according to the
model. While the problem cannot be solved optimally, we will describe state of the art approximate algorithms that provide very accurate solutions in
practice. While the theoretical properties of the algorithms will be discussed
briefly, the main emphasis will be on their application.</p>

<p><i>Â Learning
(Parameter Estimation):</i><br></p>

<p>Given a set of training samples consisting of inputs and their desired
outputs, (for example, images and the location of the objects, or MRI scans and
their segmentations) we would like to estimate a model that is suited to the
task at hand. We will show how the problem of learning a model can be
formulated as empirical risk minimization. Furthermore, we will present
efficient algorithms for solving the corresponding optimization problem.</p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/10/b69211826f81680acbbf763109177f/cours-nikos-3.jpg","Short_des":"We will present the state of the art energy minimization algorithms that are used to perform inference in modern artificial vision models: that is, efficient methods for obtaining the most likely interpretation of a given visual input.
