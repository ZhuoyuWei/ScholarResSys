They are important in determining which products we buy, which languages we speak, how we vote, as well as whether or not we decide to become criminals, how much education we obtain, and our likelihood of succeeding professionally.   The countless ways in which network structures affect our well-being make it critical to understand how social network structures impact behavior, which network structures are likely to emerge in a society, and why we organize ourselves as we do.  This course provides an overview and synthesis of research on social and economic networks, drawing on studies by sociologists, economists, computer scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.</div><div><br></div><div>The course begins with some empirical background on social and economic networks, and an overview of concepts used to describe and measure networks.   Next, we will cover a set of models of how networks form, including random network models as well as strategic formation models, and some hybrids.   We will then discuss a series of models of how networks impact behavior, including contagion, diffusion, learning, and peer influences.</div><div><br></div>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/50a9bcc99dfc058198c9d4827b11e7/Logo1.jpg","Short_des":"Learn how to model social and economic networks and their impact on human behavior.  How do networks form, why do they exhibit certain patterns, and how does their structure impact diffusion, learning, and other behaviors?   We will bring together models and techniques from economics, sociology, math, physics, statistics and computer science to answer these questions.  ","AuthorList":[{"author":"Matthew O. Jackson"}]}
