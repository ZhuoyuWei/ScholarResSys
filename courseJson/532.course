<p>The material in this course overlaps with that normally covered in classes on perception or systems neuroscience.<br></p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/51/021214d4173c4d935e0341a36e914f/brain_icon.jpg","Short_des":"This course is about how detective work by the brain creates our sense of spatial location from a variety of sensory and motor sources, and how this spatial sense in turn shapes our cognitive abilities.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Jennifer M.
