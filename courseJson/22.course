Learn about the usefulness of randomness in communication and computation, the intrinsic randomness of quantum phenomena, the unpredictability of the weather, the role of chance in evolution, and the implications of the neural activity of the brain on our "free will".","AuthorList":[{"author":"Valerio Scarani"}]}
