{"ItemName":"Fundamentals of Audio and Music Engineering: Part 1 Musical Sound &amp; Electronics","Major":"Engineering Music, Film, and Audio ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/audiomusicengpart1","Content":"<p>This 6-week course is for students who are interested in learning the
    basic concepts of sound &amp; acoustics and signals &amp; electronics as
    they relate to music. The goal is for students to understand the basic
    concepts and principles of musical acoustics and electronics and to learn
    how equipment such as electric guitars, amplifiers, and loudspeakers are
    designed and operate. Students are encouraged to put the theory into practice
    by building a simple guitar practice amplifier. The course employs high-school
    level algebra and trigonometry, no calculus is required.&nbsp;</p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b8/96492d34ff9e6824b8b0cb9e070094/FundamentalsSound_ImageLogo-3.jpg","Short_des":"In this course students learn the basic concepts of acoustics and electronics and how they can applied to understand musical sound and make music with electronic instruments.  Topics include: sound waves, musical sound, basic electronics, and applications of these basic principles in amplifiers and speaker design.
