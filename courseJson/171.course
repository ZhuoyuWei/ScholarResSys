{"ItemName":"English Composition I: Achieving Expertise","Major":"Humanities  Education Social Sciences ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/composition","Content":"<p>English Composition I provides an introduction to and foundation for the academic reading and writing characteristic of college. Attending explicitly to disciplinary context, you will learn to read critically, write effective arguments, understand the
    writing process, and craft powerful prose that meets readersâ€™ expectations. You will gain writing expertise by exploring questions about expertise itself: What factors impact expert achievement? What does it take to succeed? Who determines success?
    Since personal investment yields better writing, you can select an area of expertise meaningful to you (a hobby, trade, profession, discipline, etc.) for your major writing projects, which will be drafted and revised in sequenced stages: a critical
    review to an argument about expertise (600-800 words); an explication of a visual image (600-800 words); a case study of an expert (1000-1250 words) and an Op-Ed (500-750 words). Your writing will be central to the course as we create a seminar/workshop
    structure with peer response and selected instructor feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two overarching assumptions about academic writing will shape our work:&nbsp; 1) it is transferable; 2) it is learnable. Being an effective academic writer involves asking meaningful questions and engaging in complex dialogue with texts and ideas. These
    skills are useful across virtually all academic disciplines and they provide a valuable means for making sense of non-academic experiences as well. Perhaps even more important, though, is that learning how to write effectively does not require inspiration
    or genius, but hard work, reflection, and feedback. This means that, with practice, dedication, and working with others,<i> you</i> can be an effective academic writer and contribute your ideas to important, ongoing conversations. Let's start now.</p>
