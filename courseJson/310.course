{"ItemName":"Chemistry: Concept Development and Application Part II","Major":"Chemistry ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/genchem2","Content":"<p>This course will cover the second half of an introduction to General Chemistry, including properties of matter, phase transition and equilibrium, solution equilibrium, reaction rates and kinetics, reaction equilibrium, acid-base equilibrium and thermodynamics. &nbsp;We will&nbsp;use a free on-line textbook, Concept Development Studies in Chemistry, available via Riceâ€™s Connexions project.&nbsp;</p><p>The fundamental concepts in the course will be introduced via the <i>Concept Development Approach</i>&nbsp;developed at Rice University. &nbsp;In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning&nbsp;rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.</p><p>So why use this approach?&nbsp;<br></p><p>One reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.&nbsp; Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.&nbsp; When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them.&nbsp;</p><p>A second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.&nbsp; This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.&nbsp; It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.</p>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e0/e629cdfd12e76cf0208e84e5f76d89/CDA_logo.png","Short_des":"This course is the second semester of the two semester sequence, Chemistry Concept Development and Application.  This course will cover the topics of a typical second semester General Chemistry course at most colleges and universities.  We will use the Chemistry Concept Development Study approach, developed and used in our courses at Rice and used in Part I of this course.","AuthorList":[{"author":"John Steven Hutchinson"}]}
