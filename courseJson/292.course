{"ItemName":"Introduction to Power Electronics","Major":"Engineering ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/powerelectronics","Content":"The course is an introduction to switched-mode power converters. It provides a basic knowledge of circuitry for the control and conversion of electrical power with high efficiency. These converters can change and regulate the voltage, current, or power; dc-dc converters, ac-dc rectifiers, dc-ac inverters, and ac-ac cycloconverters are in common use. Applications include electronic power supplies, aerospace and vehicular power systems, and renewable energy systems.","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/58/79756faa2f1227bb1c6e60522f446a/image.jpeg","Short_des":"The course is an introduction to switched-mode power converters.
