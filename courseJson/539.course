rigors of college chemistry. This course is designed to give students 
the opportunity to review topics at a pace conducive to their level, 
whether they are encountering the material for the first time or are 
using the course as a refresher.<br><br><p>Allison Soult and Kim Woodrum 
bring their experience to the course covering kinetics, equilibrium, 
acid-base equilibria, aqueous equilibria and thermodynamics. Instruction consists of concepts, calculations, and video 
demonstrations of the principles being discussed. Practice problems and
 end of unit assessments will help students gauge their understanding of
 the material.</p><br>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/22/18ca2040cc56ccaf9178dff0ffeb06/AdvancedChemistryLogo.jpg","Short_des":"This course is designed to look at the topics covered in advanced high school chemistry courses, correlating to the standard topics as established by the American Chemical Society.
