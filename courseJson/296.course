{"ItemName":"Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 2","Major":"Information, Tech & Design Mathematics Health & Society ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/biostats2","Content":"This class presents fundamental concepts in data analysis and statistical inference, focusing on one and two independent samples. Students having taken this class should be able to summarize samples, perform relevant hypothesis tests and perform a collection of two sample comparisons. Classical non-parametric methods and discrete data analysis methods are discussed.  The class is taught at a master's of biostatistics introductory level and requires Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 1 as a prerequisite.","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/41/636d558d786277be88235e2a28adb6/bootcamp2_B-02.jpg","Short_des":"Learn fundamental concepts in data analysis and statistical inference, focusing on one and two independent samples.","AuthorList":[{"author":"Brian Caffo"}]}
