{"ItemName":"Calculus: Single Variable","Major":"Mathematics ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/calcsing","Content":"<p>Calculus is one of the grandest achievements of human thought, explaining everything from planetary orbits to the optimal size of a city to the periodicity of a heartbeat. This brisk course covers the core ideas of single-variable Calculus with emphases
    on conceptual understanding and applications. The course is ideal for students beginning in the engineering, physical, and social sciences. Distinguishing features of the course include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the introduction and use of Taylor series and approximations from the beginning;
    </li>
    <li>a novel synthesis of discrete and continuous forms of Calculus;</li>
    <li>an emphasis on the conceptual over the computational; and</li>
    <li>a clear, dynamic, unified approach.</li>
</ul>
