{"ItemName":"The Music of the Beatles","Major":"Music, Film, and Audio ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/beatles","Content":"The Music of the Beatles will track the musical development of the band, starting from the earliest days in Liverpool and Hamburg, moving through the excitement of Beatlemania, the rush of psychedelia, and the maturity of Abbey Road. While the focus will be on the music, we will also consider how recording techniques, the music business, the music of other artists, and the culture of the 1960s affected John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they created the Beatles repertory.<br><br>There is probably no band or artist that has had more written about their music than the Beatles. There are many good books on the band's biography, several insider accounts offering glimpses behind the scenes, books that interpret the meaning of the songs, and even books that catalog dates and people regarding the band. This course will try to synthesize much of that information into an account of the Beatles' development as musicians and songwriters.","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0e/61a0fd462aa2524f71915233b3530b/Beatles-red-legal-safe-copy.jpg","Short_des":"The Music of the Beatles will track the musical development of the band, starting from the earliest days in Liverpool and Hamburg, moving through the excitement of Beatlemania, the rush of psychedelia, and the musical maturity of Abbey Road.
