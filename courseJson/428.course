Spiderman's spidey sense? How did Wonder Woman's invisible jet work? 
What does it really mean for something to be a scientific "fact"? 
Explore how science works and what constitutes "good" science through 
case studies drawn from a wide spectrum of people's experience, for

warming. The case studies will provide the chance to act as science 
critics as the students develop a better appreciation for science and 
the scientific method.<br><br>This course won the 2011 "Best OCW User Experience" Award from Education Portal and was featured in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18superhero-t.html">New York Times</a>. <br>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c8/0738a4096cdff7b7b9ab0285618692/460px_x_259px_female_superhero_used_for_Physics_Coursera.jpg","Short_des":"Explore how science works and what constitutes "good" science through case studies drawn from a wide spectrum of people's experience, for example superheros, movies, and real world issues such as global warming.
