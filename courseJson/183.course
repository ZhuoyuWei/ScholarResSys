{"ItemName":"An Introduction to Global Health","Major":"Medicine Health & Society Food and Nutrition Social Sciences ","LinkUrl":"https://www.coursera.org/course/globalhealthintro","Content":"The course takes its starting point in the belief that good health is intimately linked with personal happiness, productivity, the economic and social development of nations and the advancement of people. <br><br>Globalization processes influence the health of individuals, societies and the function of health systems in many ways and may present opportunities but may also pose a risk to vulnerable societies. Throughout this course presentations will transcend the perspectives of individual countries and will critically discuss how global mega-trends and different sectors of society influence the health of population. Transition in health and the drivers of such transition will be core elements of this course.&nbsp; <br><br>During the six course weeks we will explore a range of themes, including: communicable and non-communicable diseases, environmental health, child health, reproductive health and rights, and health among refugees and displaced populations. We focus on the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable disease experienced by much of the world’s population today.<br><br>As the deadline for meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s) nears, course participants will also reflect on the post-MDG agenda by exploring the future of global health and trends in technical innovation, global strategies and programs in the fight for better health. Through lectures, readings, and assignments, course participants will be asked to think critically about the health of the world’s population and to reflect on overcoming the challenges of achieving good health around the world. <br>","ImageUrl":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0a/02d57e10c0b6c64ff9591583344302/global_health.jpg","Short_des":"This course will provide you with an overview of the most important health challenges facing the world today.
