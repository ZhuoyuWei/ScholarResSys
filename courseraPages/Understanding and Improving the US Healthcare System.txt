{"about_the_course":"<p>Health is important to everyone.&nbsp; For most people, that means that\nunderstanding the healthcare system is important.&nbsp; As a patient or a caregiver for a loved one,\nyour understanding of the system can mean everything from getting the right\nhelp, to economic stress in paying medical bills, to medical misadventures and\neven death.&nbsp; And if you\u2019re a healthcare\nprofessional (or are in training or want to be a healthcare professional someday),\nunderstanding the system is a critical \u2013 but often under-developed \u2013 part of\noptimizing the help you can provide your community.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Despite this importance, an understanding of the US\nhealthcare system is alarmingly rare.&nbsp;\nThis course is designed to change that \u2013 by helping students understand\nthe core structure and accomplishments of the system, the recurring\nshortcomings, and attempted remedies through policy reform.&nbsp; Rather than emphasizing complexity (a focus\nof many other courses about healthcare policy), the lessons in this course will\nhighlight central themes that learners can take away from the course and apply\nto their own experiences \u2013 and other coursework \u2013 with confidence.&nbsp; Moreover, students who seek more advanced\ncontent will have ample opportunity to tailor their learning accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In addition, through a unique, national group exercise\nthat will serve as a keystone of this course, all learners will have the\nopportunity to learn how they can improve the US healthcare system.&nbsp; Whether as individuals, in groups, or as future\narchitects of system reform, students in this course will enjoy a premier\nopportunity to understand the US healthcare system \u2013 and their options for addressing\nproblems in the system \u2013 as they never have before. &nbsp;This course is produced by Michael Rubyan, MPH, one of Dr. Davis's former students at the University of Michigan.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/92/cb812153dc3714657c2b8e4a0661fd/Course_Logo_TO_081213.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f0/ae297979487db2be536dd588fc3701/Course_Logo_TO_081213.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/61/da286f9fb4cd6d02af714aa7287668/Course_Logo_TO_081213.png","video":"p8pWD2CzMhg","university-ids":["umich"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/p8pWD2CzMhg/","id":869,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/75/07a2c2f614597144b29c9e63bbee75/U-M_Coursera_Logo-2.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"umich","china_mirror":3,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/50/52265d555e7bf0b0b86f7a1a07a183/favicon-umich.ico","website_facebook":"universityofmichigan","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99/263203c94842c44bcf757c4a801e8f/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":3,"location_city":"Ann Arbor","location_country":"US","location_lat":42.28082560000000000,"location":"Ann Arbor, MI","primary_color":"#002E5F","abbr_name":"Michigan","website":"http://www.umich.edu/","description":"The University of Michigan is a public research university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the United States.","short_name":"umich","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/70c6a457583d267a869cb6555b4de5/DIL-17Apr12_AT150a_EDIT_TO_2.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"user/um","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/36/1d953d8380a15d8eb0d307c7cde0bb/banner-umich.jpg","location_state":"MI","name":"University of Michigan","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/70/de505d47be7d3a063b51b6f856a6e2/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/26/23ecbedd1043250eab7d1b0a41696b/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6b/fce84d27ebcd493f839f14df253541/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_.svg","location_lng":-83.74303780000002000,"home_link":"","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/05/1a1f4b975bf71dba0ac79042ed651e/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_200x48.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"In this course, you will learn about the structure, accomplishments, and shortcomings of the US healthcare system, and how those have prompted attempts at reform.
