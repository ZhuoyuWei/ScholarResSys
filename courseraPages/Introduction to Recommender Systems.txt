{"about_the_course":"<p>Recommender\n systems have changed the way people find products, information, and even \nother people. They study patterns of behavior to know what someone will \nprefer from among a collection of things he has never experienced. The \ntechnology behind recommender systems has evolved over the past 20 years\n into a rich collection of tools that enable the practitioner or \nresearcher to develop effective recommenders. We will study the most \nimportant of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how \nto evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice.</p><p>The\n algorithms we will study include content-based filtering, user-user \ncollaborative filtering, item-item collaborative filtering, dimensionality \nreduction, and interactive critique-based recommenders. The approach \nwill be hands-on, with six two week projects, each of which will involve\n implementation and evaluation of some type of recommender.</p><p><b>Two Ways to Take this Course</b>:</p><p>This course is designed to support two different types of students and educational goals:</p><p><i>Programming Track</i>: &nbsp;Designed\n for students with significant programming and mathematics experience \n(see below), the programming track combines a conceptual and \nmathematical understanding of recommender systems with experience \nprogramming six different recommender systems projects. &nbsp;Students \ncompleting this travel will gain the skills needed to implement basic \nrecommenders from scratch, and to use software libraries and tools to \nimplement more advanced recommenders.</p><p><i>Concepts Track</i>:<span>\n &nbsp;Students who are not experienced programmers, or who are primarily \ninterested in understanding the concepts and techniques of recommender \nsystems, without learning to program them, can choose to focus on the \nconceptual and mathematical content, skipping the programming projects \nand associated lecture content.&nbsp; Students in the concepts track are \nstill expected to have significant familiarity with computing systems \nand college-level mathematics, but need not be accomplished programmers.\n &nbsp;We expect this track to be useful for tech-savvy marketing and \nbusiness leaders, as well as engineering managers who may oversee but \nnot directly develop recommender systems. &nbsp;We also hope it will be \nuseful to those looking to understand recommender systems concepts \nwithout the workload associated with programming those systems.&nbsp; <br></span></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b1/0dd0ff0e44a763cfba188a761ae2cb/movielens.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/42/291d55c2b40660fdbf65e590831949/movielens.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/6095ca516e757248df2abf357fde72/movielens.jpg","video":"eMlcMAa0IOg","university-ids":["minnesota"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/eMlcMAa0IOg/","id":746,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/32/051960873fd1cc2b6a315b80853ff2/minnesota.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UMNews","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f2/c0c3766390def44d6704f82d4d7955/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"UofMN","logo":"","background_color":"","id":50,"location_city":"Minneapolis","location_country":"US","location_lat":44.98333400000000000,"location":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","primary_color":"#7A0019","abbr_name":"Minnesota","website":"http://www.umn.edu/","description":"The University of Minnesota is among the largest public research universities in the country, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional students a multitude of opportunities for study and research.
