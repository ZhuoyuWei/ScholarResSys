{"about_the_course":"Design thinking is a popular new idea in the business world - organizations as diverse as entrepreneurial start-ups, big established corporations, and government and social service organizations are experimenting with design thinking as an alternative\napproach to traditional problem-solving. Accelerated by the spectacular rise of <a href=\"http://goo.gl/9HryvA\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"http://goo.gl/N11yoS\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://goo.gl/N11yoS\">IDEO</a>, design thinking is seen as offering a new approach better suited for dealing with the accelerating pressures for growth and innovation faced by so many organizations\ntoday. But design thinking can remain mysterious for people interested in introducing this approach into their decision-making processes. Demystifying it is the focus of this course.\n\n<p><span>Though <i>designing</i> as a\ncraft requires years of dedicated education and talent to master, <i>design thinking</i>, as a problem solving\napproach, does not. In this course, we work with the following model that\ncontains four </span>questions and ten tools:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://coursera-topic-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/12e27d2216ba70fd7089556c788733/design_business.jpg\" title=\"Image: https://coursera-topic-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/12e27d2216ba70fd7089556c788733/design_business.jpg\">\n    <br><span>The four sequential questions that take us on a journey through an\nassessment of current reality <i>(What is?),</i>\nthe envisioning of a new future (<i>What\nif?),</i> the development of some concepts for new-business opportunities (<i>What wows?</i>), and the testing of some of\nthose in the marketplace (<i>What works?</i>).\n</span>The process of design thinking begins with data gathering: at the outset of the design process, designers gather a great deal of data on the users they want to create value for.\u00a0 They mostly do this through ethnographic methods like experience\n    mapping, rather than traditional methods like focus groups and surveys. Farther along in the process, designers make their new ideas concrete (in the form of prototypes) and go out and get better data from the real world in a process that is hypothesis-driven.\n    That is, they treat their new ideas as hypotheses to be tested. They surface the assumptions underlying their hypotheses and test them \u2013 usually looking for the kind of behavioral metrics that will allow them to iterate their way to improved value\n    propositions.</div>\n\n<p>Accompanying the four questions is a set of new tools to help business people achieve the same kind of disciplined approach to innovation and growth that they bring to the rest of their business. In this course, we will look at the stories of a wide variety\n    of organizations - major corporations like <b><a href=\"http://goo.gl/5yTYks\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://goo.gl/5yTYks\">IBM</a></b>, entrepreneurial start-ups like <b><a href=\"http://goo.gl/2NhoYR\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://goo.gl/2NhoYR\">MeYouHealth</a></b>, and even social service organizations like\u00a0<b><a href=\"http://goo.gl/ZPI3D3\" target=\"_blank \" title=\"Link: http://goo.gl/ZPI3D3\">The Good Kitchen</a></b>\u00a0-\n    all using the design thinking tools and approach to achieve better outcomes.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/94/59de1ad853a29aaaefab7cc10c29a0/Coursera-Logo.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bd/958e8c4c73fee0decf3a57623f8cb9/Coursera-Logo.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a4/10191863975c9c73c522432412b6d1/Coursera-Logo.png","video":"UHpQXC8rPfg","university-ids":["uva"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/UHpQXC8rPfg/","id":436,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/8cf6b18a752fa9ba66be05d904571d/favicon-uva.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/a193b107772ef0132965d063f454f5/uvalogo-coursera.png","location_lat":38.02930590000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Charlottesville","location_country":"US","id":18,"location":"Charlottesville, VA","primary_color":"#3565A6","abbr_name":"Virginia","website":"","description":"The University of Virginia is distinctive among institutions of higher education.

We\u2019ll conclude session 1 by examining what\nkinds of problems and challenges are best suited for a design thinking\napproach.</span>\n\n<p><b>Week 2: How can we prepare ourselves to\nbe leaders of innovation?</b><span> Design\nthinking is not only about process and tools, however. It is about people as\nwell - about <i>you</i> as a design thinker\nand about the people you want to create value for and with. And so, before we jump\ninto the process of using design thinking to generate and test ideas, we want\nto first focus on your own mindset and look at how whether \u00a0your mind is prepared to both see and to act\non opportunity when it shows up in your world. We will examine this issue by\nlooking at the stories of two very capable managers <b>George </b>and<b> Geoff</b> -\nand how their differing mindsets impact their ability to lead innovation and\ngrowth. \u00a0We\nwill also look at the role of visualization tools that use imagery and storytelling\nto bring ideas to life. </span></p>\n\n<p><b>Week 3: How can you use design thinking\nto generate ideas?</b> Now we\nwill take a deeper dive into the design thinking process, looking at how we can\nuse it to generate better ideas. This week, we will look at the story of an\nentrepreneur, Chris Cartter, and his start-up,\u00a0<b><a href=\"http://goo.gl/2NhoYR\" target=\"_blank\">MeYouHealth</a></b><span>, as they worked with\nBoston design firm, <b><a href=\"http://goo.gl/fA6wjI\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://goo.gl/fA6wjI\">Essential Design</a></b>, to understand the kind of\nopportunity that social networking might hold for helping us to improve our\nhealth.\u00a0 <span>Examining\nwhat already exists is the first step in the design thinking process. As part\nof assessing <i>what is</i> designers\n\u201cfollow the customer home\u201d and explore the problems they are trying to solve in\nlife versus their product use. </span>Once they have thoroughly explored and\nlooked for patterns in <i>what is</i>, designers\nlook towards the future and ask <i>what if?</i>\nThese two questions - what <i>is</i> and what\n<i>if</i> - \u00a0\u00a0along with the tools associated with them, will\nbe the focus of week 3. This is the creative part of the process - but it also\ncontains a disciplined approach. Ethnographic\ntechniques like journey mapping help us dig deep to understand the whole\ncustomer experience. Tools like mind mapping help us make sense of the data collected.\nTools like structured brainstorming and concept development help move from the\ncreation of a mass of unrelated ideas to the construction of robust concepts\nthat are worth moving into testing.</span>\u00a0\n\n</p><p><b>Week 4: How can you use design thinking\nto test ideas?</b> \u00a0Having generated all\nthese great ideas, what\u2019s next? The design thinking process now helps us to\ntake the many ideas we have generated, and figure out how to figure out which\nones are likely to produce the specific kind of outcomes we want -whether these\ntake the form of improved nutrition for the elderly (<b><a href=\"http://goo.gl/ZPI3D3\" target=\"_blank\">The Good Kitchen</a></b>), healthier life style choices (<b><a href=\"http://goo.gl/2NhoYR\" target=\"_blank\">MeYouHealth</a></b>) or even more \u201chot leads\u201d emanating from your trade shows\n(in the\u00a0<b><a href=\"http://goo.gl/5yTYks%20\" target=\"_blank \">IBM</a></b>\u00a0example we will look at in this session). In this session,\nwe will follow the activities of an\u00a0<b><a href=\"http://goo.gl/5yTYks%20\" target=\"_blank \">IBM</a></b><span>\u00a0team working\nclosely with experience marketing agency<b>, <a href=\"http://goo.gl/OJlc22\" target=\"_blank\">George P. Johnson</a></b><span>, as they develop and test ideas for a revolutionary\napproach to trade show participation. This process begins by asking <i>what wows?</i> This question brings together\nthe customer and business cases supporting our new concepts. Typically, the\n\u201cwow\u201d zone occurs at the intersection of three criteria: somebody wants it, we\ncan create and deliver it, and doing so has the potential to produce the\noutcomes we as an organization want.\u00a0 </span>Then\nwe ask\u00a0 <i>what works?</i> and conduct small experiments to test out whether our assumptions\nare in fact accurate. Design thinking tools like\u00a0 prototyping, co-creation and learning launch\nhelp us along the way.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Week 5: So what?</b> Having now completed our review of the\ndesign thinking process, looked at some tools, and examined our own mindsets to\nbe sure that we are prepared to lead, we turn to the question of outcomes. What\nkinds of changes can we expect to see coming out of the process? And moving\nforward, what do we need to do to capitalize on the opportunities that design\nthinking brings?</p>","course_format":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course will\nconsist of a series of videos and on-line discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bd/958e8c4c73fee0decf3a57623f8cb9/Coursera-Logo.png","suggested_readings":"<div><a href=\"http://goo.gl/phtMAF\" title=\"Link: http://goo.gl/phtMAF\">Designing for Growth: A manager\u2019s design thinking toolkit</a>, by Jeanne Liedtka and Tim Ogilvie.\u00a0<br>\n    <p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/cXqi2M\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://goo.gl/cXqi2M\">Solving Problems with Design Thinking:\nTen Stories of What Works</a><i>, \u00a0</i><span>by Jeanne Liedtka<i>, </i>Andrew King and\nKevin Bennett<i>. </i>\u00a0</span>\n    </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n    <br>\n</div>\n<br>","instructor":"Jeanne M.
