{"about_the_course":"<p>Statistics One is designed to be a comprehensive yet friendly introduction\n    to fundamental concepts in statistics. Comprehensive means that this course\n    provides a solid foundation for students planning to pursue more advanced\n    courses in statistics. Friendly means exactly that. The course assumes\n    very little background knowledge in statistics and introduces new concepts\n    with several fun and easy to understand examples.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This course is, quite literally, for everyone. If you think you can't\n    learn statistics, this course is for you. If you had a statistics course\n    before but feel like you need a refresher, this course is for you. Even\n    if you are a relatively advanced researcher or analyst, this course provides\n    a foundation and a context that helps to put one\u2019s work into perspective.</p>\n<p>Statistics One also provides an introduction to the R programming language.\n    All the examples and assignments will involve writing code in R and interpreting\n    R output. R software is free! What this means is you can download R, take\n    this course, and start programming in R after just a few lectures. That\n    said, this course is not a comprehensive guide to R or to programming in\n    general.\u00a0</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/81/df2e4c697721f4fa58e270fb810c36/course-logo.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/04/95377c7b544250674cd4fb40792a6f/course-logo.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/7f9a5ca0231d151c230f3feb8f3c38/course-logo.png","video":"uzmp_iqLxzk","university-ids":["princeton"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/uzmp_iqLxzk/","id":25,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"princeton","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/29daf4b768e1aa467202d4d2dcf8d8/favicon-princeton.ico","website_facebook":"PrincetonU","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/94/cc9200e336d38ce029873b13cbe93b/logo-princeton-front.png","background_color":"","id":4,"location_city":"Princeton","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.35729760000000000,"location":"Princeton, NJ","primary_color":"#BA632D","abbr_name":"Princeton","website":"http://www.princeton.edu/","description":"Princeton University is a private research university located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.

He has been teaching introduction to statistics for undergraduate students and advanced statistics for graduate students for 16 years. The first 8 years of his teaching career were at the University of Illinois in Chicago. He has been at Princeton since 2004. Professor Conway is originally from upstate New York and did his undergraduate work at Union College in Schenectady, NY where he majored in Psychology and Computer Science. For graduate school, Professor Conway attended the University of South Carolina where he earned a Masters degree and Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology with a minor in Statistics. Professor Conway also maintains an active research program and is the Principal Investigator of the Human Working Memory Lab in the Psychology Department at Princeton. He and his graduate students investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying memory, attention, and intelligence. This work has resulted in over 40 publications in various journals in Psychology and Neuroscience. He is also an Associate Editor for the Journal of Cognitive Psychology.","university_logo":"","course-ids":[102,970574],"display":true,"recommended_background":"Anyone and everyone is welcome to take this class.
