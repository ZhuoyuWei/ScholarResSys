{"about_the_course":"This course explores various strategies that middle and high school teachers\ncan use to integrate engineering practices into science lessons and laboratory\ninvestigations that they already do. This course will start by comparing\nand contrasting the research methods employed by scientists and engineers.\nThe course will then demonstrate ways that teachers can facilitate, sequence,\nand assess lessons designed to help students understand and apply engineering\nprinciples. These principles include learning to (1) design within constraints,\n(2) analyze and interpret data, (3) construct models, and (4) conduct iterative\ntests. Upon completing this course, teachers will possess a deeper understanding\nof engineering and be able to effectively teach engineering processes to\ntheir students.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/49/4e2f81f56fbbe61c3011e264115c87/TI-Builders.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/34/fe8df9aa2840176a343a541ebac8d0/TI-Builders.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a3/cf20f6ca30287f4a1aa8c88aa9d678/TI-Builders.jpg","video":"-qvmEwsRGmc","university-ids":["exploratorium"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/-qvmEwsRGmc/","id":616,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"exploratorium","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"exploratorium","logo":"","background_color":"","id":108,"location_city":"SF","location_country":"US","location_lat":37.77492950000000000,"location":"San Francisco, CA","primary_color":"","abbr_name":"exploratorium","website":"http://www.exploratorium.edu/","description":"The Exploratorium is a twenty-first-century learning laboratory, an eye-opening, always-changing, playful place to explore and tinker.
