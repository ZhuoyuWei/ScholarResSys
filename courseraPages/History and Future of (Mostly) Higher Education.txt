What if\n    the actual learning cannot be tested or assessed by the usual methods of higher education?

This week offers (and also invites)\n    ideas about what we can do together. It makes a powerful argument that we all need to advocate (in any country) for higher education and shows how, in the U.S., the decline in support for public education has contributed to income inequality and hurt all our future.\u00a0 This week includes interviews with inspiring people who have worked together to make successful change happen in society ad in education, against odds. \u00a0</p>\n<p><b></b>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Conclusion</b>: Thank you for joining this movement on behalf of educational innovation and reform! \u00a0This is not the end. \u00a0It\u2019s the beginning. \u00a0Where will we do from here?
