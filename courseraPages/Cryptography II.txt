{"about_the_course":"Cryptography is an indispensable tool for protecting information in computer systems. &nbsp;This course is a continuation of <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto\">Crypto I</a> and explains the inner workings of public-key systems and cryptographic protocols. &nbsp; Students will learn how to reason about the security of cryptographic constructions and how to apply this knowledge to real-world applications. The course begins with constructions for digital signatures and their applications. &nbsp; We will then discuss protocols for user authentication and zero-knowledge protocols. &nbsp; &nbsp;Next we will turn to privacy applications of cryptography supporting anonymous credentials and private database lookup. &nbsp;We will conclude with more advanced topics including multi-party computation and elliptic curve cryptography. &nbsp;Throughout the course students will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field. &nbsp; The course will include written homeworks and optional programming labs. &nbsp;The material is self-contained, but the course assumes knowledge of the topics covered in <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto\">Crypto I</a> as well as a basic understanding of discrete probability theory.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/crypto2/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/crypto2/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/crypto2/large-icon.png","video":"","university-ids":["stanford"],"video_baseurl":"","id":127,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png","background_color":"","id":1,"location_city":"Palo Alto","location_country":"US","location_lat":37.44188340000000000,"location":"Palo Alto, CA, United States","primary_color":"#8C1515","abbr_name":"Stanford","website":"","description":"The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.","short_name":"stanford","landing_page_banner":"","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"","partner_type":1,"banner":"","location_state":"CA","name":"Stanford University","square_logo":"","square_logo_source":"","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-122.14301949999998000,"home_link":"http://online.stanford.edu/","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Learn about the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and protocols and how to apply this knowledge in real-world applications.","description":"","short_name":"crypto2","target_audience":1,"faq":"<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a certificate after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Statement of accomplishment will be given to students who obtain more than 70% of the maximum score on the problem sets and final exam.
