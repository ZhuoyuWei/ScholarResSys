{"about_the_course":"<p></p><p><b></b>What is Climate Change? How should we respond to\nClimate Change? These questions are complex, not least because the responses\navailable to us depend upon who is providing the answers and the particular\nperspective they take. The economist sees the economic challenges and\nopportunities of Climate Change; the scientist sees the need to describe and\nexplain Climate Change; the policy-maker and social scientist\nsee Climate Change as a social problem. Therefore, the first step to\nunderstanding Climate Change and what we do about it is to see how experts from\ndifferent disciplines engage with\u00a0the issue. The second step is to appreciate how\nour response to Climate Change depends upon the interplay between these\ndifferent approaches.</p>\n\n<p>This course offers you an introduction to different\ndisciplinary perspectives on Climate Change to help you think about how Climate Change\naffects you as an individual, as a member of your local community, as a citizen\nof your country and as a member of the global community. We have designed the\npresentations, discussions, activities and assessment tasks in this course to\nhelp you understand what Climate Change is and what you \u2013 and we \u2013 should do about it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fd/77d8ec9f8149868a7ad2306e92e054/climate_montage.jpeg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6f/090e9db35bd6f072a336d02e9d6794/climate_montage.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/11/a8c4ccbd5e53770228170c6ef6692a/climate_montage.jpg","video":"kedFopq74u8","university-ids":["unimelb"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/kedFopq74u8/","id":184,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/72/4f6e42ac66db3c62341bc3b1397ca6/CourseEraSecondary.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"unimelb","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/fc137263568a25c66e2cc5f98ca899/UOM_16x16pxLogo.png","website_facebook":"melbuni","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/59304da07d93c8a2cbfc5ac4c6a269/Mel1.png","background_color":"","id":33,"location_city":"Melbourne","location_country":"AU","location_lat":-37.81410700000000000,"location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","primary_color":"#003366","abbr_name":"UniMelb","website":"http://www.unimelb.edu.au/","description":"The University of Melbourne is an internationally recognised research intensive University with a strong tradition of excellence in teaching, research, and community engagement.
