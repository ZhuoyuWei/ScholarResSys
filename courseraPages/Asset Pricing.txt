{"about_the_course":"<div>Are you curious about quantitative academic finance? Have you considered graduate study in finance? Are you working in an investment bank, money-management firm or hedge fund and you want to understand models better? Would you like to know what buzzwords like beta, risk premium, risk-neutral price, arbitrage, and discount factor mean? This class is for you. <br><br>We will see how one basic idea, price equals expected discounted payoff, unites everything - models that describe stocks, bonds, options, real investments, discrete time, continuous time, asset pricing, portfolio theory, and so forth.\u00a0</div><div><br></div><div>We'll start with the underlying consumption-based model, and we\u2019ll preview the classic issues in finance. We\u2019ll think about asset pricing in a simple economic equilibrium. Then, we'll take a step back and study contingent claims and the theorems showing the existence of a discount factor (the m in p=E(mx)). We'll explore the mean-variance frontier and expected return vs. beta models and factor structures. A brief tour of current facts and puzzles follows. Then, off to study options and the Black-Scholes formula, bond pricing models and facts. We will close with modern portfolio theory.\u00a0</div><div><br></div><div>The math in real finance is not actually that hard. Understanding how to use the equations, and see what they really mean about the world... that's hard, and that's what I hope will be uniquely rewarding about this class.</div>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/11/e916c4b2d9b75d8dcb320ee53d2c9d/e-ticker.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b8/8bf632251389246d00263b01c1cced/e-ticker.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0b/b40542fa8d0258b94d50fb593454b0/e-ticker.jpg","video":"U5CfYQw4X7k","university-ids":["chicago"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/U5CfYQw4X7k/","id":724,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UChicago","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"uchicago","logo":"","background_color":"","id":102,"location_city":"Chicago","location_country":"US","location_lat":41.87811360000000000,"location":"Chicago, IL","primary_color":"#800000","abbr_name":"Chicago","website":"http://www.uchicago.edu/","description":"One of the world's premier academic and research institutions, the University of Chicago has driven new ways of thinking since our 1890 founding.

Samuelson Award for scholarly writing on lifelong financial security, John Cochrane's Asset Pricing now appears in a revised edition that unifies and brings the science of asset pricing up to date for advanced students and professionals. Cochrane traces the pricing of all assets back to a single idea--price equals expected discounted payoff--that captures the macro-economic risks underlying each security's value. By using a single, stochastic discount factor rather than a separate set of tricks for each asset class, Cochrane builds a unified account of modern asset pricing. He presents applications to stocks, bonds, and options. Each model--consumption based, CAPM, multifactor, term structure, and option pricing--is derived as a different specification of the discounted factor.\nThe discount factor framework also leads to a state-space geometry for mean-variance frontiers and asset pricing models. It puts payoffs in different states of nature on the axes rather than mean and variance of return, leading to a new and conveniently linear geometrical representation of asset pricing ideas.\nCochrane approaches empirical work with the Generalized Method of Moments, which studies sample average prices and discounted payoffs to determine whether price does equal expected discounted payoff. He translates between the discount factor, GMM, and state-space language and the beta, mean-variance, and regression language common in empirical work and earlier theory.\nThe book also includes a review of recent empirical work on return predictability, value and other puzzles in the cross section, and equity premium puzzles and their resolution. Written to be a summary for academics and professionals as well as a textbook, this book condenses and advances recent scholarship in financial economics."}],"signature_track_open_time":null,"eligible_for_ACE":false,"grading_policy_normal":"The final grade is based on weekly quizzes, weekly problem sets, and a final exam.
