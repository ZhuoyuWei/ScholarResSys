{"about_the_course":"With its walls razed to ground by Babylon\u2019s armies, Jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished cities\u2014from Ur and Nineveh and Persepolis to Babylon itself. While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.\u00a0 But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.\u00a0 The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope. \u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>Working through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity\u2019s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors\u2019 visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:\u00a0 the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life. <br>\u00a0<br>The objectives of the course are to show: <br>\u2014how the Bible emerged from large-scale corporate crisis and rupture;<br>\u2014that in our present state of uncertainty and instability we have much to learn from the various strategies the biblical authors adopted to create an enduring \u201cpeople of the book\u201d;<br>\u2014that one doesn\u2019t have to believe in God or accept the historicity of the Bible in order to appreciate its profound political messages;<br>\u2014that the Bible offers modern societies a model for creating communities around a shared collection of texts, songs, and laws;<br>\u2014and that the Bible itself has a major role to play in our futures.<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/51/b1c0ccbfc15fb49e3719618b36929f/wright-class.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/07bad8aae255113ef03f86b6c0775f/wright-class.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/2e/b9e71ca3f5551267e71f671b837ce5/wright-class.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["emory"],"video_baseurl":"","id":1182,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/89/d4f18b4cab9d87ed66c4355d907121/emory_horizontal_coursera.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"EmoryUniversity","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a2/835a1009fc4245f378dd8add26dabc/Shield_280.jpg","website_facebook":"EmoryUniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7e/1f0e877a7a22c338bdfb128a4726f9/EU_hz_280.png","background_color":"","id":23,"location_city":"Atlanta","location_country":"US","location_lat":33.74899540000000000,"location":"Atlanta, GA, United States","primary_color":"#002878","abbr_name":"Emory","website":"http://www.emory.edu/","description":"Emory University, located in Atlanta, Georgia, is one of the world's leading research universities.
