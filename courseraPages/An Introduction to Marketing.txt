{"about_the_course":"<p><b>PART OF THE WHARTON FOUNDATION SERIES</b>\u00a0\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This course is part of the Wharton foundation series in the MOOC format. It is taught by three of Wharton's top faculty in the marketing department, which is consistently ranked as the #1 marketing department in the world. This course features on-location\n    videos and debates between the three professors.</p>\n<p>The three core topics focus on customer loyalty. The first is about branding: given a very disparate world in which new startups are emerging constantly, brand equity is one of the key elements of keeping customers so that they have a trusted source for\n    their needs. The second topic is customer centricity, which is taught in a global context where students learn how to gather needs and focus on the customer via discussion forums and empirical examples which are advanced by the mix of cultures in\n    the course. Finally, the course explores practical, go-to-market strategies to help students understand the drivers that influence customers and see how these are implemented prior to making an investment.</p>\n<br>\n<p></p>\n<b>Click below for the other Wharton Foundation Series courses:</b>\n<p></p>\n<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/finance\" target=\"_blank\">An Introduction to Corporate Finance</a>\n<br><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/accounting\" target=\"_blank\">An Introduction to Financial Accounting </a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/operations\" target=\"_blank\">An Introduction to Operations Management</a>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/15/8740e81f3ff6f107ec8371bfc81730/coursera_marketing_600.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/995ed65d17a0c64825781974c53e52/coursera_marketing_600.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ae/4fb390cafa5ab8e71ea173001e6783/coursera_marketing_600.png","video":"DsoW8pS_GbQ","university-ids":["penn"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/DsoW8pS_GbQ/","id":747,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/14/c965e1f5cf9ead221ad770bd907f3a/Penn-logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"pennopencourses","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png","background_color":"","id":6,"location_city":"Philadelphia","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.95233500000000000,"location":"Philadelphia, PA","primary_color":"#0000FF","abbr_name":"Penn","website":"http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning","description":"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.
