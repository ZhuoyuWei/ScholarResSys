{"about_the_course":"<p>In this class we will cover the essentials of genomics to help you better\nunderstand your own life (know thy genome, know thyself), and how advances in\nbiotechnology are radically changing the scientific landscape.</p>\n\n<p>We will begin with some of the most basic issues\nof genetics, such as the composition of genomes and how the information in them\nis processed so we can get an adult human from an egg. Then we\u2019ll see that much\nof the power of genomics is in comparisons. If I only had your genome there's\nnot much I could do with it. But if I lined it up against a chimpanzee genome\nI\u2019d see that they are 98.5% identical. It\u2019s that 1.5% difference that we study to\ndetermine what makes a chimp a chimp and a human a human.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>In the next few years you\u2019ll be able\nto get your genome done for a few hundred dollars, and we will look at the\nchallenges you might face dealing with this new self-knowledge. We shall\nparticularly focus on behavior. How can genes predispose some of us to be nice\nand others of us to be psychopaths? We will be examining behavior as a complex\nunfolding of interactions between your genome and the environment. </p>\n\nThanks in large part to genomics we are\nbeginning to understand the living processes that constitute ourselves, where\nwe can begin to intervene to take control of our own future. We will look at\nthe technologies involved and the consequences of this new power. Genetic\nengineering has already changed what you eat and the medicines you take, and will\nlikely therefore change how long you live. If we choose to genetically engineer\nourselves as some advocate then we may also change how we view ourselves as\nhuman beings. We do not know where our ability to intervene in our own living\nprocesses is going to lead us. Depending on your point of view that is the\npromise or the threat of the era we live in. Scientists today already envisage\ncreating life from scratch, and we are entering a world where political considerations,\nand imagination, may be the only brakes on biotechnology.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9d/700b2427e5b2413b3baa34c4287dcd/Genes.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/47/dbc72025125b1fcf426aedc02be1b4/Genes.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a1/136c177d13b81a589adeb2bcd6f994/Genes.jpg","video":"WOg-zOZHwSY","university-ids":["umd"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/WOg-zOZHwSY/","id":295,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/34/994080afbadb0c7bffae332a673aaf/University_of_Maryland_Logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UofMaryland","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/81bc9a607b97fadd8a2fdd6b66bfc2/favicon_16x16.ico","website_facebook":"UnivofMaryland","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/fd/01ba206b961003d2e4eb052d0ceac6/primarylogosm.png","background_color":"","id":32,"location_city":"21, Berwyn","location_country":"US","location_lat":38.98969670000000000,"location":"College Park, Maryland, USA","primary_color":"#990000","abbr_name":"UMD","website":"http://www.umd.edu/","description":"The University of Maryland is the state's flagship university and one of the nation's preeminent public research universities.
