{"about_the_course":"<p>Some of the\nmost powerful and widely applicable research-proven instructional practices are\nthose of cooperative learning, which are highly effective in engaging and\nmotivating students. When implemented correctly, such practices have been\nproven to increase students\u2019 achievement in a wide range of content areas at\nall grade levels. Cooperative learning models will be explored to understand\nthe variables that differentiate group work from true cooperative learning,\nincluding individual accountability and group rewards. The effectiveness of\nstudent teams to support learning through peer motivation, peer assessment and\nreteaching will be examined in depth.</p>\n\n<p><b>Course Objectives</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Define the concept of cooperative learning and how it relates to\ntoday\u2019s learner.<br></li><li>Describe how cooperative learning works when there is individual\naccountability, equal opportunities for success and team recognition built into\na task.<br></li><li>Describe the four theoretical perspectives of cooperative\nlearning.<br></li><li>Consider the impact of cooperative learning on 21st\ncentury skills and meeting the cognitive demands of the Common Core State\nStandards.<br></li></ul><p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/09826bfc5d62c2946c55d645222112/DSC_6912.JPG","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a6/228fe8e8f4477258e1f38e0be9d603/DSC_6912.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/eb/df0bc9f5c358cb11dbcbbfa3394b12/DSC_6912.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["jhu"],"video_baseurl":"","id":655,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/0fb2d85007ca7f6d671b73e64a44d6/nursing.logo.large.horizontal.blue.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"JohnsHopkins","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico","website_facebook":"johnshopkinsuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png","background_color":"","id":8,"location_city":"Baltimore","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.29038480000000000,"location":"Baltimore, MD","primary_color":"#0061AA","abbr_name":"Johns Hopkins","website":"http://www.jhu.edu/","description":"The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.","short_name":"jhu","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"johnshopkins","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg","location_state":"MD","name":"Johns Hopkins University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/229e9cabab40da92cdd0fc46cd7e06/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/4b4ca39464d8fd3a75bf8a68d0a1d9/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-76.61218930000001000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Founded in more than 25 years of research, this course will engage students in various forms of cooperative learning including STAD (Student-Teams Achievement-Divisions) which continues to empower students to work together to improve their understanding of mathematics concepts through a collaborative learning approach.","description":"","short_name":"cooperativelearning","target_audience":null,"faq":"<p><b>Who should take this course?<br>\n</b>This\ncourse is intended for teachers and administrators who are looking for ways to\nincorporate 21st century skills in their current teaching practices,\nas well as practical classroom applications that can enable students to not\nonly care about their individual learning, but also that of their classmates.</p><p><b>Who will teach\nthe course?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Paul D.
