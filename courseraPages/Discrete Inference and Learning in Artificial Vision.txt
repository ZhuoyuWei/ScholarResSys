{"about_the_course":"<p>Artificial\nvision applications, such as object detection in natural images and automatic\nsegmentation of medical acquisitions, rely on models that interpret the visual\ninformation provided to a computer. The model provides a compromise between the\nsupport given by the observations and the prior domain knowledge. This course\nis concerned with the two computational problems that arise when using such models\nin practice.</p>\n\n<p><i>Inference\n(Energy Minimization):</i></p>\n\n<p>Given a visual observation (for example, an image or an MRI scan), we\nare interested in estimating its most likely interpretation (i.e. the location of all\nthe objects in the image, or the segments of the MRI scan) according to the\nmodel. While the problem cannot be solved optimally, we will describe state of the art approximate algorithms that provide very accurate solutions in\npractice. While the theoretical properties of the algorithms will be discussed\nbriefly, the main emphasis will be on their application.</p>\n\n<p><i>\u00a0Learning\n(Parameter Estimation):</i><br></p>\n\n<p>Given a set of training samples consisting of inputs and their desired\noutputs, (for example, images and the location of the objects, or MRI scans and\ntheir segmentations) we would like to estimate a model that is suited to the\ntask at hand. We will show how the problem of learning a model can be\nformulated as empirical risk minimization. Furthermore, we will present\nefficient algorithms for solving the corresponding optimization problem.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/10/b69211826f81680acbbf763109177f/cours-nikos-3.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/f7b976278464c9a688848455fc9c31/cours-nikos-3.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/92c895d16927e3a67f5a8eb9d6369e/cours-nikos-3.jpg","video":"QPZeBdr3fHM","university-ids":["ecp"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/QPZeBdr3fHM/","id":749,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/49966a1e7aebf1e35bfe46127c1c39/logo-coursera-wide.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"centraleparis","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"ecolecentraleparis","logo":"","background_color":"","id":128,"location_city":"Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry","location_country":"FR","location_lat":48.77189600000000000,"location":"Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, France","primary_color":"#745E5E","abbr_name":"ECP","website":"http://www.ecp.fr/","description":"Since its creation in 1829, Ecole Centrale Paris, a French Ivy League \"Grande Ecole\" has trained high-level engineers.
