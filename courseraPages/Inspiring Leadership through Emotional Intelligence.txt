{"about_the_course":"<p>Great leaders move us through our emotions. They establish a deep emotional\n    connection with others called resonance. Their own levels of emotional\n    intelligence allow them to create and nurture these resonant relationships.\n    They use their EI as a path to resonant leadership through mindfulness,\n    hope, compassion, and playfulness. Unfortunately, most people in leadership\n    and helping positions (i.e., doctors, teachers, coaches, etc.) lose their\n    effectiveness over time because of the cumulative damage from chronic stress.\n    But humans can renew themselves, neurologically, hormonally, and emotionally.</p>\n<p>Based on decades of\u00a0research into emotional intelligence\u00a0competencies\n    and longitudinal studies of their development, the course will examine\n    resonance and developing \"resonant leadership\" capability,\u00a0emotional\n    intelligence, and the experiences of mindfulness, hope, and compassion.\n    Using the latest in neuroscience, behavioral, organizational and psychological\n    research, participants will\u00a0understand the theory, research, and experience\n    of the Positive Emotional Attractor that is an essential beginning to sustained,\n    desired change for individuals, teams, organizations and communities.\u00a0</p><p>The course will consist of nine classes, with three or so\nmodules per class, to be taken over 8 weeks. Each module will consist of a\nvideo, assigned and recommended readings, reflective exercises, writing in your\nPersonal Journal, and on-line, asynchronous discussions. Each class will have personal\nlearning assignments to use and tests of comprehension.\u00a0</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/09/417bb17c47b134bf9399974d250bec/147669568.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/846ea70a3c01d0b3ae27ad125023f3/147669568.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/fd5ca575e9b7dde1ba926b5b8546aa/147669568.jpg","video":"NH4_Ptj0C28","university-ids":["casewestern"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/NH4_Ptj0C28/","id":463,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/8255814ca84557904c82a1af99b109/CWRU.Logo.Blue.200x48.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"thinkintweets","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"casewesternreserve","logo":"","background_color":"","id":68,"location_city":"Cleveland","location_country":"US","location_lat":41.49949540000000000,"location":"Cleveland, OH","primary_color":"#0A304E","abbr_name":"Case Western","website":"http://case.edu/","description":"Case Western Reserve is a leading national urban research university committed to imagining and influencing the future. \nOur alumni include the inventor of the Nike Air Sole, the developer of Gmail, founders of Fortune 500 companies \u2013 and thousands of others who contribute enormously to society every single day.\n","short_name":"casewestern","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/64/1aebbe96feea77d395e3a7031ffef4/CWRU_1280x320b-1.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"case","partner_type":1,"banner":"","location_state":"OH","name":"Case Western Reserve University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a8/f082d763f49ef3a14862a5f01ae5bd/360x360_CWRU.logo.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f6/873a2a4ffc08a4f4e63c8e599d53de/360x360_CWRU.logo.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d7/932ae91edfdca6dc818b27432fb34f/360x360_CWRU-1.logo.svg","location_lng":-81.69540880000000000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6a/83fd0011850673e052c17e9dec58ac/200x48_CWRU.logo.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Emotional intelligence, hope, mindfulness, and compassion help a person reverse the damage of chronic stress and build great leadership relationships.
