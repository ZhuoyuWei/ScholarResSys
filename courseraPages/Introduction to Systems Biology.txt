{"about_the_course":"<p>This\ncourse will introduce the student to contemporary Systems Biology focused on\nmammalian cells, their constituents and their functions.&nbsp; Biology is moving from molecular to modular.\nAs our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists\nof molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need\nto understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that\nact as discrete functional systems.&nbsp;\nThese systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal\ntransduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn\nthese processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion,\nproliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular\nand cellular systems?&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the\nmechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise?&nbsp; What types of experiments inform systems-level\nthinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these\nsystems?</p>\n\n<p>The course will develop multiple lines of\nreasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads\nare: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that\nproduce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations.&nbsp; Examples will be discussed to demonstrate\n\u201chow\u201d cell- level functions arise and \u201cwhy\u201d mechanistic knowledge allows us to\npredict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.<br></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/42/1b8fdf11bde18fd7fed9d2c24d1c03/Introduction_SB_logo_600X340.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/72/4db0747e655a276f56f04bc4c2df5b/Introduction_SB_logo_600X340.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c3/884cafdf7c3e8abc2717367304fb3a/Introduction_SB_logo_600X340.png","video":"","university-ids":["mssm"],"video_baseurl":"","id":178,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"mountsinainyc","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6e/050cc941c1081a711d979b25b7b108/Course_catalog_page_16x16.png","website_facebook":"MountSinaiMedicine","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/40/20e4ab932508164766302a9bf01c5c/mount_sinai.png","background_color":"","id":27,"location_city":"New York","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.71435280000000000,"location":"New York, NY","primary_color":"#0F487C","abbr_name":"Mount Sinai","website":"http://www.mssm.edu/","description":"The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, formerly the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, is an American medical school in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.
