{"about_the_course":"<p>There is a growing global need in agricultural production for a workforce that is capable of integrating knowledge of animal health and production with an understanding of consumer preferences in the context of economic reality, business efficiency, and\nethical constraint.\u00a0 However, current evidence suggests that there is a growing shortage of people with the knowledge and problem-solving skills required to match the rapid advances being made in animal health, science, and food production.\u00a0\nThe results of this shortage are wide-ranging and could lead to challenges in food security and agricultural economic competitiveness in some countries.</p><p>In this course we will explore the effect of infectious disease on sustainable animal-based food production. The content and learning outcomes of this new course will be designed to be relevant across different food production sectors (i.e., beef, dairy, poultry,\n    and pigs). While the instructors will provide the participants with a strong scientific base for understanding the impact of infectious disease in animal-based food production, the emphasis of the material will be on practical problem-solving and\nwill be    directed towards equipping participants with a platform for developing the skills needed to contribute to sustainable food production.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/26/1392c18d81c21f84f37c4de112e785/food-sustainability-logo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/e7d183191a2786b0990cab5e5b395d/food-sustainability-logo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/54/736f4d5d7fe72e628c8c5a79199067/food-sustainability-logo.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["illinois"],"video_baseurl":"","id":1178,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/6401c0ebc5e834eed7f5017d6d80fd/illinois-svg.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Illinois_Alma","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2b/57d79bc1eb5b081e6a1b3729782566/favicon.png","website_facebook":"illinois.edu","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/ff5237ed042c63a02e67e2094e97c1/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign.png","background_color":"","id":17,"location_city":"Cunningham","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.11058750000000000,"location":"Urbana, Illinois","primary_color":"#003C7D","abbr_name":"Illinois","website":"http://illinois.edu/","description":"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a world leader in research, teaching and public engagement, distinguished by the breadth of its programs, broad academic excellence, and internationally renowned faculty and alumni.
