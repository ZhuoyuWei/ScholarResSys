{"about_the_course":"<p>The\ncourse Network Analysis in Systems Biology provides an introduction to network\nanalysis and statistical methods used in contemporary Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology research. Students will learn how to construct, analyze and\nvisualize different types of molecular networks, including gene regulatory\nnetworks connecting transcription factors to their target genes,\nprotein-protein interaction networks, cell signaling pathways and networks, drug-target and drug-drug similarity networks and other functional association networks. Methods to process raw data from genome-wide\nRNA (microarrays and RNA-seq) and proteomics (IP-MS and phosphoproteomics)\nprofiling will be presented. Processed data will be clustered, and gene-set\nenrichment analyses methods will be covered. The course will also discuss\ntopics in network systems pharmacology including processing and using databases\nof drug-target interactions, drug structure, drug/adverse-events, and drug\ninduced gene expression signatures.\u00a0\u00a0 </p>\n\n<span>Half of the course will contain theoretical discussions of advanced topics in the field but with the assumption that the course participants are from diverse backgrounds. The course will also have practical tutorials for analyzing various high content experimental datasets going from the raw data to finished high quality figures for publication. Standard statistical methods for high content data analysis will be covered.\u00a0The\ncourse is appropriate for beginning graduate students and advanced\nundergraduates. Lectures provide background knowledge in understanding the\nproperties of large datasets collected from mammalian cells. In the course we\nwill teach how these datasets can be analyzed to extract new knowledge about\nthe system. Such analyses include clustering, data visualization techniques,\nnetwork construction, and gene-set enrichment analyses. The\ncourse will be useful for students who encounter large datasets in their own\nresearch, typically genome-wide. The course will teach the students how to use existing\nsoftware tools such as those developed by the <a href=\"http://www.mssm.edu/research/labs/maayan-laboratory\">Ma\u2019ayan Laboratory</a> at Mount\nSinai, but also other freely available software tools. In addition the course\nrequires the students to write short scripts in Python and\u00a0participate in\u00a0</span>crowdsourcing\u00a0microtask projects. The ultimate aim of the course is to enable students to utilize the methods they learn here for analyzing their own data for their own projects.<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/42/73766b4b2470c124521362d489baea/coursera_image_maayan.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ea/5fd940fc642a384fa660e012ee8fdf/coursera_image_maayan.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c7/e692242fb5e98d2bb83b330b6115b8/coursera_image_maayan.png","video":"SnkEFrhzqCU","university-ids":["mssm"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/SnkEFrhzqCU/","id":179,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"mountsinainyc","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6e/050cc941c1081a711d979b25b7b108/Course_catalog_page_16x16.png","website_facebook":"MountSinaiMedicine","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/40/20e4ab932508164766302a9bf01c5c/mount_sinai.png","location_lat":40.71435280000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"New York","location_country":"US","id":27,"location":"New York, NY","primary_color":"#0F487C","abbr_name":"Mount Sinai","website":"http://www.mssm.edu/","description":"The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, formerly the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, is an American medical school in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.
