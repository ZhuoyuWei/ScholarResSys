{"about_the_course":"<p>The pioneering work of Professor Carl\nWoese on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus has revolutionized\nour understanding of the fundamental structure and evolutionary relatedness of\nall living entities on Earth. This has resulted in a new \"Tree of Life\" and a first ever understanding of what life looked like before the\nbase of the root of the Tree had evolved. <br></p><p>Although these concepts from Woese's\nwork are central to cutting-edge genome-enabled research in all fields from\nmedicine to energy, these understandings are currently only minimally (if at\nall) taught in classrooms around the world. <br></p><p>This course will evaluate the\nentire history of life on Earth within the context of our cutting-edge\nunderstanding of the Tree of Life. This includes\u00a0reconnaissance\u00a0of ancient\nprimordial life before the first cell had evolved, the entire ~4-billion-year\ndevelopment of single- and multi-celled life through the lens of the Tree of Life, and\nthe influence of Earth system processes (meteor impacts, volcanoes, ice sheets)\non shaping and structuring the Tree.\u00a0 This synthesis emphasizes the universality of the\nemergence of life as a prelude for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/fb79c3943bfd4c42c796c934aebdb4/emergence-of-life-logo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/50/08729aa120cdbfd9534044d8bb65ae/emergence-of-life-logo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b9/77ccdd0849bf343dda7d399ae2d5aa/emergence-of-life-logo.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["illinois"],"video_baseurl":"","id":1177,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/6401c0ebc5e834eed7f5017d6d80fd/illinois-svg.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Illinois_Alma","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2b/57d79bc1eb5b081e6a1b3729782566/favicon.png","website_facebook":"illinois.edu","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/ff5237ed042c63a02e67e2094e97c1/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign.png","background_color":"","id":17,"location_city":"Cunningham","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.11058750000000000,"location":"Urbana, Illinois","primary_color":"#003C7D","abbr_name":"Illinois","website":"http://illinois.edu/","description":"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a world leader in research, teaching and public engagement, distinguished by the breadth of its programs, broad academic excellence, and internationally renowned faculty and alumni.
