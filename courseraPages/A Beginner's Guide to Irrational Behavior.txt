{"about_the_course":"Behavioral economics and the closely related field of behavioral finance couple scientific research on the psychology of decision making with economic theory to better understand what motivates investors, employees, and consumers. This course will be based heavily on my own research. We will examine topics such as how emotion rather than cognition determines economic decisions, \u201cirrational\u201d patterns of thinking about money and investments, how expectations shape perceptions, economic and psychological analyses of dishonesty by presumably honest people, and how social and financial incentives combine to motivate labor by everyday workers and CEOs alike. This highly interdisciplinary course will be relevant to all human beings. <br><br>This class has two main goals:<ol>\n<li>To introduce you to the range of cases where people (consumers, investors, managers, and significant others) make decisions that are inconsistent with standard economic theory and the assumptions of rational decision making. This is the lens of behavioral economics.</li>\n<li>To help you think creatively about the applications of behavioral economic principles for the development of new products, technology based products, public policies, and to understand how business and social policy strategies could be modified with a deeper understanding of the effects these principles have on employees and customers.</li>\n</ol>","subtitle_languages_csv":"pt,ru","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/behavioralecon/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/behavioralecon/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/behavioralecon/large-icon.png","video":"dzSfmkbQClk","university-ids":["duke"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/dzSfmkbQClk/","id":123,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/65/b1eae360095757f04b8bfda5fdbb62/Duke_University_Logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"DukeU","china_mirror":3,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/500c9f41731d797a0e108a4edd8bc1/favicon-duke.ico","website_facebook":"DukeUniv","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/67/20d9fca42bddac2034668d7b589cad/dukewidelogo_vert.png","background_color":"","id":7,"location_city":"Durham","location_country":"US","location_lat":35.99403290000000000,"location":"Durham, NC, USA","primary_color":"#003366","abbr_name":"Duke","website":"http://duke.edu/","description":"Home of the Blue Devils, Duke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
