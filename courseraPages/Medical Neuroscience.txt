{"about_the_course":"Medical Neuroscience explores the organization and physiology of the human central nervous system. This course is designed for first-year students in graduate-level health professions programs. It builds upon knowledge acquired in prior studies of cellular and molecular biology, general physiology, and human anatomy. The course provides students an understanding of the essential principles of neurological function, from cellular and molecular mechanisms of neural signaling and plasticity to the organization and function of sensory and motor systems. This course emphasizes the neural and vascular anatomy of the human brain and spinal cord, providing an anatomical framework for localizing lesions within the central nervous system. It also emphasizes the neurobiological foundation for understanding cognition, mental illness and disorders of human behavior. <br><br> The overall goal is to equip students in the health professions for interpreting impairments of sensation, action and cognition that accompany neurological injury, disease or dysfunction. Students currently pursuing advanced studies in the brain sciences will benefit from this course by learning the fundamentals of functional human neuroanatomy and how neuroscience discovery translates to clinical practice. &nbsp;Health professionals will benefit from the opportunity to review and update knowledge of foundational medical neuroscience.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/medicalneuro/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/medicalneuro/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/medicalneuro/large-icon.png","video":"q5kUhps_F0Q","university-ids":["duke"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/q5kUhps_F0Q/","id":59,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/65/b1eae360095757f04b8bfda5fdbb62/Duke_University_Logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"DukeU","china_mirror":3,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/500c9f41731d797a0e108a4edd8bc1/favicon-duke.ico","website_facebook":"DukeUniv","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/67/20d9fca42bddac2034668d7b589cad/dukewidelogo_vert.png","background_color":"","id":7,"location_city":"Durham","location_country":"US","location_lat":35.99403290000000000,"location":"Durham, NC, USA","primary_color":"#003366","abbr_name":"Duke","website":"http://duke.edu/","description":"Home of the Blue Devils, Duke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
