{"about_the_course":"<p>Discourse on war and peace has gone through a remarkable transition during\n    the two decades after the end of the Cold War. We do not have to worry\n    of major nuclear wars, and then, no longer can we anticipate stability\n    based on nuclear deterrence. We have no immediate threat emanating from\n    a belligerent adversary equipped with a major arsenal, but we observe a\n    number of small to medium military powers that are more belligerent than\n    the days of the Soviet Union. We have more democracies in the world, and\n    yet are far from the democratic peace that has been imagined by the students\n    of international relations.</p>\n<p>This course aims to nail down some of the basic issues that had been argued\n    in the current research on peace and security. The questions are all deceptively\n    simple enough, but then the answers will all be ambiguous at best. It is\n    my hope that you will be able to provide better answers than those given\n    in the course by developing your own analytical capacity.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4c/02907fbdab2d35e1ca65cd58a087d3/c_ConditionsofWarandPeace.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/8b/4c5a0d24dea1ad1ca6a9c507b88abd/c_ConditionsofWarandPeace.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/69/fe4f7437b7c144076f0b4ec43d2a93/c_ConditionsofWarandPeace.jpg","video":"ndR0GVgpsu4","university-ids":["todai"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/ndR0GVgpsu4/","id":482,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Todai_News_en","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"Todai.News.en","logo":"","background_color":"","id":76,"location_city":"","location_country":"JP","location_lat":35.68948750000000000,"location":"Tokyo, Japan","primary_color":"#52A8FF","abbr_name":"Todai","website":"http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/","description":"The University of Tokyo, also known as \"Todai\", was established in 1877 as the first national university in Japan.
