{"about_the_course":"<p>The American health care system has many problems. 50 million people are uninsured. Quality is extremely uneven, with peaks of greatness at leading academic centers but overall poor quality in both process measures and outcomes such as asthma deaths. Finally, the U.S. health care system spends over $8000 per patient per year, nearly double the next highest country. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Over the next decade or more, the Act will dramatically re-structure the American health care system.</p>\n<p>This course will explore the history and structure of the current American health care system, including the history of and problems with employment-based health insurance, the challenges surrounding access, cost and quality, and the medical malpractice conundrum. The course will then explore the history of health care reform and the challenges that were overcome to achieve health reform in America. Finally, we will delineate the specific ways that the Affordable Care Act improves access and quality, and will control costs. Throughout lessons regarding health economics, health policy, and medical practice will be elucidated.</p>\n<p>This class is open to anyone that is interested in gaining a better understanding of the US health care system and the challenges of health care reform. There are no prerequisites or required knowledge of the health system.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/healthpolicy/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/healthpolicy/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/healthpolicy/large-icon.png","video":"I9HDz30z6Kk","university-ids":["penn"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/I9HDz30z6Kk/","id":33,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/14/c965e1f5cf9ead221ad770bd907f3a/Penn-logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"pennopencourses","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png","background_color":"","id":6,"location_city":"Philadelphia","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.95233500000000000,"location":"Philadelphia, PA","primary_color":"#0000FF","abbr_name":"Penn","website":"http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning","description":"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

In the summer of 2012, 17,246 people were\nsigned up to take the course on the first week of lectures and 31,967 people\nwere registered by end of the course.&nbsp;\nHowever, of those students, 3,428 submitted the first assignment and\n1,066 submitted the final assignment.&nbsp;\n1,340 people completed at least five assignments and 1,023 people passed\nthe course.&nbsp; While there is more attrition\nthan in a traditional classroom, this is in part due to the online, free aspect\nof the course as people may sign up who are curious, but are not interested in\ncompleting the course.<b><i>&nbsp; </i></b>This\ncourse offers significant flexibility for students in terms of not only when\nyou do the work, but also how much you complete.&nbsp; Some students wish to learn as much as\npossible about the topic while others are interested in learning only a portion\nof the material.&nbsp;

Grading will be\ndouble-blind; graders will not know whose work they are grading, and students\nwill not know who graded their work.&nbsp;\nEach assignment is graded by several different people, which will reduce\nany potential bias, with the high and low scores dropped for each student.&nbsp; Furthermore, the selection of assignments to\ngrade for each person will be random each week, so any given student is\nunlikely to have his/her work graded by any given student grader more than once.&nbsp; Finally, we will be checking the grading for\nconsistency (e.g. by comparing against grades assigned by the instructor to a\nfew \"sample\" assignments).</li><li><b><i>Why do you require students to grade each other?</i></b><br>This course is freely available on the internet.&nbsp; During the summer 2012 course, 31, 967\nstudents signed up for the course.&nbsp;\nCoursera and the University of Pennsylvania are not able to support\nproviding this course free for everyone without utilizing innovative and\nnon-traditional grading mechanisms.&nbsp;
