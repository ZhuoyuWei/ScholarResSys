{"about_the_course":"<h2>Why 3 Versions?</h2>\n\n<p><b>Note</b>: In January 2014 we will offer 3 versions of this course so\n    that you can choose a version that best meets your needs. Two of the versions\n    are identical except for the duration of the course. The third version\n    is both shorter and covers slightly less material, focusing on just the most critical\n    aspects of microeconomics principles. See further below for more details\n    about the differences.</p>\n\n<h2>About the Course</h2>\n\n<p>Most people make the incorrect assumption that economics is ONLY the study\n    of money. \u00a0My primary goal in this course is to shatter this belief.\n    \u00a0In fact, in the last 50 years economists have tackled some of the\n    most interesting and important questions for humanity. \u00a0For instance,\n    the following are just a few examples:</p>\n<div>\n    <ul>\n        <li>About Love and Marriage\n            <ul>\n                <li>Why is the divorce rate so high and what should we do in order to reduce\n                    it?</li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>About the Environment\n            <ul>\n                <li>Why do we have so much pollution?</li>\n                <li>How much is an endangered species worth?</li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <div>About Crime</div>\n            <div>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Would legalizing marijuana lead to a reduction in crime?</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <div>About Labor Markets</div>\n            <div>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Does increasing the Federal Minimum Wage put people out of work?</li>\n                    <li>Why did so many women enter the labor force during the last 40 years?</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <div>About things you should be worrying about</div>\n            <div>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Why is a college education a smart investment? Or isn't?</li>\n                    <li>Why are the presidential candidates missing the point on college costs?</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <div>And about many other things:</div>\n            <div>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Would school vouchers lead to improvements in public education?</li>\n                    <li>Why a draft would only damage the army?</li>\n                    <li>How to level the playing field in baseball?</li>\n                    <li>AND, why is COURSERA offering this course free of charge?</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n<p>Additional questions we will consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What economists do and the strange way they think? (Basic Concepts, Modeling and Trade)</li>\n<li>What determines prices and quantity\n    in a market economy? (Supply and Demand)</li>\n<li>What is the relationship between\n    free market economies and social welfare? (Market Efficiency and Government\n    Intervention)</li>\n<li>What are the distributional effects\n    of taxes? (Elasticity and Taxes)</li>\n<li>What is the relationship between\n    production and costs in a firm? (Production and Costs)</li>\n<li>How competitive firms choose their\n    efficient level of output? (Competitive Output)</li>\n<li>What are the pricing policies of\n    firms with some degree of market power? (Firms With Market Power)</li>\n<li>How much pollution is too much pollution?\n    (Public Goods, Common Resources and Externalities)</li>\n<p>We will be addressing many of these (and many more) questions\nduring this course. Again, my main goal will to show you the way economists\nthink and how to use this analytical system to answer questions related\nnot only to these and other important human issues but pretty much to anything\nyou end up doing with your life after this class. After all, as you will\nquickly find out, I believe everything is economics!</p></ul>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/microecon/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/microecon/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/microecon/large-icon.png","video":"Jo_778kG1Ck","university-ids":["illinois"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/Jo_778kG1Ck/","id":138,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/6401c0ebc5e834eed7f5017d6d80fd/illinois-svg.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Illinois_Alma","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2b/57d79bc1eb5b081e6a1b3729782566/favicon.png","website_facebook":"illinois.edu","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/ff5237ed042c63a02e67e2094e97c1/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign.png","background_color":"","id":17,"location_city":"Cunningham","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.11058750000000000,"location":"Urbana, Illinois","primary_color":"#003C7D","abbr_name":"Illinois","website":"http://illinois.edu/","description":"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a world leader in research, teaching and public engagement, distinguished by the breadth of its programs, broad academic excellence, and internationally renowned faculty and alumni.
