{"about_the_course":"Many students leave high school without being prepared for the \nrigors of college chemistry. This course is designed to give students \nthe opportunity to review topics at a pace conducive to their level, \nwhether they are encountering the material for the first time or are \nusing the course as a refresher.<br><br><p>Allison Soult and Kim Woodrum \nbring their experience to the course covering kinetics, equilibrium, \nacid-base equilibria, aqueous equilibria and thermodynamics. Instruction consists of concepts, calculations, and video \ndemonstrations of the principles being discussed. Practice problems and\n end of unit assessments will help students gauge their understanding of\n the material.</p><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/22/18ca2040cc56ccaf9178dff0ffeb06/AdvancedChemistryLogo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/af/ae652f7fff52312cacecbed5380d05/AdvancedChemistryLogo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/91/889964b3e1415ddf3d3a6e50a0e10e/AdvancedChemistryLogo.jpg","video":"y06SyKU-dY4","university-ids":["uk"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/y06SyKU-dY4/","id":1204,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"universityofky","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/10/87bdc6b92b1472d6985970cfab5840/UK16.png","website_facebook":"universityofky","logo":"","background_color":"","id":127,"location_city":"Lexington","location_country":"US","location_lat":38.04058370000000000,"location":"Lexington, KY","primary_color":"#005DAA","abbr_name":"UK","website":"http://www.uky.edu/","description":"The University of Kentucky is the Commonwealth\u2019s flagship, land-grant institution of higher learning.

You will examine the reactions on the macroscopic as well as molecular level and see how concentration and temperature play a role in the rates at which reactions occur.<b><br></b>\n<br><b>Equilibrium<br></b>This unit examines the quantitative and qualitative relationships between the relative amounts of products and reactants to see how far a reaction will proceed.<b><br></b>\n<br><b>Acid-Base Equilibria\u00a0<br></b>The concepts of equilibria from the previous unit are applied to acids and bases.\u00a0 Comparisons of strength and relationships between pH, pOH, and concentrations of H^+ and OH^- will be studied.<b><br></b>\n<br><b>Aqueous Equilibria<br></b>This unit continues and expands on the theme of equlibria. You will examine buffers, acid/base titrations and the equilibria of insoluble salts.<b><br></b>\n<br><b>Thermodynamics<br></b>The overarching theme of thermodynamics is the prediction of whether a reaction will occur spontaneously under a certain set of conditions. Entropy and Free Energy are defined and utilized for this purpose.","course_format":"The class consists of lecture videos, which are approximately 10 to 15 minutes in length.
