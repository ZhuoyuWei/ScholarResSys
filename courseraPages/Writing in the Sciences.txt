{"about_the_course":"<div>This course trains scientists to become more effective, efficient, and confident writers. This is a hands-on course that emphasizes interactive examples and practice. In the first four weeks, we will review principles of effective writing, examples of good and bad writing, and tips for making the writing process easier. In the second four weeks, we will examine issues specific to scientific writing, including: authorship, peer review, the format of an original manuscript, and communicating science for lay audiences. Students will complete editing exercises, write two short papers, and edit each others\u2019 work.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The primary audience is undergraduate science majors, graduate students in scientific disciplines, and professional scientists. Students from non-science disciplines can also benefit from the training provided in the first four weeks (on general principles of effective writing).<br><br><b>Subtitles for</b>&nbsp;<b>all video lectures available in</b>: English, Portuguese&nbsp;(provided by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://www.fundacaolemann.org.br/\">Lemann Foundation</a>), Ukrainian (<a href=\"http://pinchukfund.org/en/\" title=\"Link: http://pinchukfund.org/en/\">Pinchuk Foundation</a>)<br></div>","subtitle_languages_csv":"pt","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/sciwrite/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/sciwrite/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/sciwrite/large-icon.png","video":"4xdond91JfU","university-ids":["stanford"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/4xdond91JfU/","id":157,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png","background_color":"","id":1,"location_city":"Palo Alto","location_country":"US","location_lat":37.44188340000000000,"location":"Palo Alto, CA, United States","primary_color":"#8C1515","abbr_name":"Stanford","website":"","description":"The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.","short_name":"stanford","landing_page_banner":"","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"","partner_type":1,"banner":"","location_state":"CA","name":"Stanford University","square_logo":"","square_logo_source":"","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-122.14301949999998000,"home_link":"http://online.stanford.edu/","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"This course teaches scientists to become more effective writers, using practical examples and exercises.
