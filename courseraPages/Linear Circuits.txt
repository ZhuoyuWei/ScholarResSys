{"about_the_course":"This course is a first introduction to electrical systems. It includes\nthe analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors\nwith DC and AC sources in the time domain and in the frequency domain.\nLaboratory demonstrations are given to reinforce the concepts learned from\nthe lectures and homework. The course is targeted at people with a scientific\nor technical background who are not electrical or computer engineers. The\ncoverage is not as deep as a circuits course aimed at electrical engineers.\nThere are a number of physical applications demonstrated in this course\nthat serve to motivate this topic to a wider audience. The course is ideal\nfor someone who wants to gain a basic understanding of electrical circuits,\nsomeone who wants to get better intuition for what they have already learned,\nprecocious hobbyists, or for someone who is considering electrical engineering\nas a career.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/68/ace50dbd4ca2634742d651e327911e/ECE3710-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e4/375f51f74dfdecb8bb6e134d001b88/ECE3710-icon.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/2906ae6522f8a73bc7fd067a2e165b/ECE3710-icon.png","video":"efFy5DDQ5Qw","university-ids":["gatech"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/efFy5DDQ5Qw/","id":554,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/f7803ce100fc4fd2ff4314a25995b3/Coursera-STO-logo-01.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"georgiatech","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/88/4d9c7e8a6ad0e787553d8b9d77d450/favicon-gatech.ico","website_facebook":"georgiatech","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/30/4b35cef753fcd6f13494279b65dc84/Georgia-Tech.png","background_color":"","id":9,"location_city":"Atlanta","location_country":"US","location_lat":33.77846260000000000,"location":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA","primary_color":"#C59353","abbr_name":"Georgia Tech","website":"http://www.gatech.edu/","description":"The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the nation's top research universities, distinguished by its commitment to improving the human condition through advanced science and technology.\n\nGeorgia Tech's campus occupies 400 acres in the heart of the city of Atlanta, where more than 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students receive a focused, technologically based education.","short_name":"gatech","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/24/0de4d4975ff698bdce7b8cf2f86c88/GT-Coursera-Banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"georgiatech","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ee/a21fe3506486f9ef6b5d7ca324d55f/banner-gatech.jpg","location_state":"GA","name":"Georgia Institute of Technology","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/27/a693dcb342a1ed209fdb0c2de7e6a3/GT-Coursera-logo-square.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/be/3e07cb47dd285544de28654fb24b18/GT-Coursera-logo-square.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/29/c5d764e8d4ad4eca175ca2f7a6ae40/GT-Coursera-logo-square.svg","location_lng":-84.39888059999998000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/4371496c5361191aa6a9721cfbe1cf/Georgia-Institute-of-Technology.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Learn the analysis of circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
