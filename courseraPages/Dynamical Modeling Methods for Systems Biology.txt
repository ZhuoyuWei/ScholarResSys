{"about_the_course":"<p>We\ntake a case-based approach to teach contemporary mathematical modeling\ntechniques.&nbsp; The course is appropriate\nfor advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students.&nbsp; Lectures provide biological background and\ndescribe the development of both classical mathematical models and more recent\nrepresentations of biological processes.&nbsp;\nThe course will be useful for students who plan to use experimental\ntechniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling\nas a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments. The course should also\nbe valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct\noriginal research in modeling biological systems.</p>\n\n\n\nThis course focuses on\ndynamical modeling techniques used in Systems Biology research.&nbsp; These techniques are based on biological\nmechanisms, and simulations with these models generate predictions that can\nsubsequently be tested experimentally. These testable predictions frequently\nprovide novel insight into biological processes.&nbsp; The approaches taught here can be grouped\ninto the following categories:&nbsp; 1)\nordinary differential equation-based models, 2) partial differential\nequation-based models, and 3) stochastic models.&nbsp; <br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e8/02ae40e3741db67bf46f40941e1965/Dynamical_modeling_Logo_460X270_v2.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/67/cd059d678aea29903129739e27addf/Dynamical_modeling_Logo_460X270_v2.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c9/6d1f5b8584be57df13528aab65576e/Dynamical_modeling_Logo_460X270_v2.png","video":"","university-ids":["mssm"],"video_baseurl":"","id":181,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"mountsinainyc","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6e/050cc941c1081a711d979b25b7b108/Course_catalog_page_16x16.png","website_facebook":"MountSinaiMedicine","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/40/20e4ab932508164766302a9bf01c5c/mount_sinai.png","background_color":"","id":27,"location_city":"New York","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.71435280000000000,"location":"New York, NY","primary_color":"#0F487C","abbr_name":"Mount Sinai","website":"http://www.mssm.edu/","description":"The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, formerly the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, is an American medical school in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.
