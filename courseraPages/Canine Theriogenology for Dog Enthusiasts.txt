I earned Bachelor\u2019s degrees in Biology and Veterinary Science, and completed veterinary college at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine. After working in small animal private practice for several years, I returned to the University of Minnesota, where I completed a residency and earned a PhD in theriogenology, or animal reproduction. I was licensed as a theriogenologist, or animal reproductive specialist, in 1994. I am employed as a clinician at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, where I am also a professor and serve as vice-chair of the department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences and as Assistant Dean of Education. I have been awarded membership in the Academy of Distinguished Teachers and in the Academy for Scholarship in Teaching and Learning at the University of Minnesota, and was named Theriogenologist of the Year in the United States for my efforts in theriogenology education.\u00a0 I am the author of several veterinary texts and one text for dog breeders and I am a frequent speaker for lay and veterinary audiences. <br><br><br>","university_logo":"","course-ids":[970556,971452],"display":true,"recommended_background":"Participants should have a basic grasp of biology and general familiarity with dog anatomy and normal dog behavior. <br>"}
