{"about_the_course":"Financial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field involving finance and economics, mathematics, statistics, engineering and\u00a0computational methods.\u00a0\u00a0The emphasis of <b>FE & RM</b>\u00a0<b>Part I</b> will be\u00a0on the use of\u00a0simple stochastic models to price derivative securities in various asset classes\u00a0including equities, fixed income, credit and mortgage-backed securities. We will also consider the role that some of these asset classes played during the financial crisis. A notable feature of this course will be an interview module with\u00a0<b>Emanuel Derman</b>, the renowned ``quant'' and best-selling author of \"My Life as a Quant\".\u00a0\u00a0<br><br>We hope that students who complete the course and the follow-up course (<b>FE & RM</b> <b>Part II</b>) will have a good understanding of the \"rocket science\" behind financial engineering. But perhaps more importantly, we hope they will also understand the limitations of this theory in practice and why financial models should always be treated with a healthy degree of\u00a0skepticism.\u00a0\u00a0","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4e/abedaed7a2250f35f243e91fc72609/stocksii.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d9/e3e13f8e3992b1578fe77a15ba45b8/stocksii.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/c3a1db5e96d08466ffd385255ac63d/stocksii.jpg","video":"VhU4bFtJ1g0","university-ids":["columbia"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/VhU4bFtJ1g0/","id":809,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"columbia","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/72/c9b56e3ff66fa6e1ca52bdea9440ae/ColumbialittleLOGO4.png","website_facebook":"Columbia","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/42f2eca2f10769400d1f8519892413/ColumbiaLOGO.png","background_color":"","id":40,"location_city":"New York","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.71435280000000000,"location":"New York City, NY, USA","primary_color":"#1F2F60","abbr_name":"Columbia","website":"http://www.columbia.edu/","description":"For more than 250 years, Columbia has been a leader in higher education in the nation and around the world.
