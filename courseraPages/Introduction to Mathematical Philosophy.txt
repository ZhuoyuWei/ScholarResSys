{"about_the_course":"<p>Since antiquity, philosophers have questioned the foundations--the foundations of the physical world, of our everyday experience, of our scientific knowledge, and of culture and society.\u00a0In recent\nyears, more and more young philosophers have become\u00a0convinced\nthat, in order to understand these foundations, and thus to make progress\u00a0in\nphilosophy, the use of mathematical methods is of crucial importance.\nThis is what our course will be concerned with:\nmathematical philosophy, that is, philosophy done with the help of\u00a0mathematical\nmethods.</p><p></p><p>As we will try to show, one\u00a0can analyze philosophical concepts much more clearly in mathematical terms, one can derive philosophical conclusions from philosophical assumptions by mathematical proof, and one can build mathematical models in which we can study philosophical problems.</p><p></p><p>So, as Leibniz would have said: even in philosophy, <i>calculemus</i>. Let's calculate.</p><p></p><p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d0/f05ee62896e67c6b150042cab93529/LogoMathPhil11.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/0c882ed4049498e49834ff054421b6/LogoMathPhil11.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/46/73a43c2b90d50c70a211d868a46f22/LogoMathPhil11.jpg","video":"9gO31jhI7xU","university-ids":["lmu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/9gO31jhI7xU/","id":432,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/0e/9145506f8bafba7c4c29fdde573a60/Unbenannt-4.png","website_facebook":"","logo":"","background_color":"","id":64,"location_city":"M\u00fcnchen","location_country":"DE","location_lat":48.13660690000000000,"location":"Munich, Germany","primary_color":"#006633","abbr_name":"LMU Munich","website":"http://www.en.lmu.de/","description":"As one of Europe's leading research universities, LMU Munich is committed to the highest international standards of excellence in research and teaching.
