{"about_the_course":"This course will introduce you to some of the main areas of research in contemporary philosophy. Each week a different philosopher will talk you through some of the most important questions and issues in their area of expertise. We\u2019ll begin by trying\nto understand what philosophy is \u2013 what are its characteristic aims and methods, and how does it differ from other subjects? Then we\u2019ll spend the rest of the course gaining an introductory overview of several different areas of philosophy. Topics you\u2019ll\nlearn about will include:\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n    <li>Epistemology, where we\u2019ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists in, and how we come to have it;</li>\n    <li>Philosophy of science, where we\u2019ll investigate foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;</li>\n    <li>Philosophy of Mind, where we\u2019ll ask questions about what it means for something to have a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;</li>\n    <li>Moral Philosophy, where we\u2019ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions \u2013 whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or cultural preferences, and;</li>\n    <li>Metaphysics, where we\u2019ll think through some fundamental conceptual questions about the nature of reality.</li>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n</ul>","subtitle_languages_csv":"zh","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/introphil/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/introphil/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/introphil/large-icon.png","video":"KEYj6NB23rA","university-ids":["edinburgh"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/KEYj6NB23rA/","id":108,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/6f0cac699523103808a9303765f54e/UoE-vector-side-align.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UniofEdinburgh","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d3/bcdd33b2d979d2bea9467b17f9bbbb/favicon-edinburgh.ico","website_facebook":"UniversityOfEdinburgh","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7f/781467d4f282293bb644ca68683509/UoE-Logo-200x48-Left-Centred-Text-Trans-v3.png","background_color":"","id":14,"location_city":"Edinburgh","location_country":"GB","location_lat":55.95325200000000000,"location":"Edinburgh, United Kingdom","primary_color":"#002675","abbr_name":"Edinburgh","website":"http://www.ed.ac.uk/","description":"Delivering excellence in teaching and learning. \n\nConsistently ranked as one of the world's top 50 universities and top 3 UK provider of online Masters courses.
