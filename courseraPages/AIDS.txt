Guest faculty names are listed in the syllabus below and their CVs are part of the course materials (If you haven't enrolled yet, I'd suggest Googling their name&nbsp;plus the term 'Emory'). &nbsp;The bio below is for the Lead Instructor, Dr. Kimberley (Kimbi) Hagen.</p><p>Dr. Hagen is director of the CFAR LINCS Initiative at the <a href=\"http://www.cfar.emory.edu\">Center for AIDS Research at Emory University</a>\n(CFAR), in Atlanta Georgia, associate director of the CFAR Developmental Core,\nand an assistant professor in the Department of Behavioral Science and Health\nEducation at the Rollins School of Public Health. She is also the director/goddess\nof two science organizations related to AIDS, the <a href=\"http://www.cfar.emory.edu/vdc/\">Vaccine Dinner Club</a> (official motto:\n\u201cHot Food, Cool Science \u2026 Count Me In!\u201d) and the CFAR Network Pizza Party\n(official motto: \u201cBetter Science Through Pizza\u201d). Over the course of almost\nthree decades she has worked variously as a community educator, patient\neducator, medical educator, science educator, and research mentor in the field\nof HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Hagen\u2019s entry\ninto AIDS came in 1985, only four years into the epidemic, when she began\nvolunteering as a community educator at <a href=\"http://www.aidatlanta.org/page.aspx?pid=295\">AID Atlanta</a>, one of the\nnation's first AIDS service organizations. In 1988 she joined the&nbsp;Emory School of Medicine&nbsp;as a medical educator for Emory\u2019s first AIDS-specific grant, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.seatec.emory.edu/index.html\">Southeast AIDS Training and\nEducation Center</a> (SEATEC). Because, in the early days of the epidemic,\nalmost all practicing doctors, nurses, dentists, and other health care providers&nbsp;had finished their training before the advent\nof AIDS, SEATEC was charged with teaching&nbsp;health profession students and practitioners in a four\nstate area how to provide care for patients with HIV while protecting\nthemselves physically and emotionally.</p>\n\n<p>In 1988 Dr. Hagen also began working as a patient educator in\nthe newly formed <a href=\"http://www.gradyhealth.org/clinic/63/\">Grady Memorial\nHospital Infectious Disease Program</a> (IDP). Although the majority of the\n5,000 patients that the IDP now sees annually are fully versed in the latest\nresearch about HIV treatment, in the IDP\u2019s earliest days most of the patients\nthat Dr. Hagen worked with had never even heard of the disease that was making\nthem sick.</p>\n\n<p>In 1998 Emory University received its first funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for a Center for AIDS Research (CFAR)&nbsp;to expand the depth and breadth of HIV/AIDS research taking place at the University\nand Dr. Hagen was recruited help organize the new Center. At CFAR\nshe fosters multidisciplinary linkages; produces a weekly electronic newsletter, the <a href=\"http://www.cfar.emory.edu/lincs/communication/news.html\"><i>Network News</i></a>; helps bring new faculty into AIDS\nresearch; and assists junior faculty in developing their HIV/AIDS research\ncareers. She also works on contract with the CDC to provide workforce\ndevelopment training for HIV/AIDS medical staff in Africa, supervises\ngraduate student research on HIV/AIDS, and is a member of the City of Atlanta Jurisdictional HIV Prevention Planning Group and the Ryan White Outside Review Committee for the State of Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Hagen is the recipient of two of the highest honors that\nEmory University&nbsp;can bestow: the Emory Award of Distinction and Teacher of the Year.&nbsp; She has made it her life\u2019s work to help\npeople understand the complexity of HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>","university_logo":null,"course-ids":[970218],"display":true,"recommended_background":"<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>This course does not assume any prior knowledge of, or\ncoursework in, HIV/AIDS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p></p>"}
