{"about_the_course":"This\n course serves as an introduction to linear and discrete \noptimization from the viewpoint of a mathematician or computer \nscientist.\u00a0 Besides learning how linear and discrete optimization can be applied, we focus on \nunderstanding methods that solve linear programs and discrete optimization problems in a mathematically \nrigorous way. <br><br>We will answer\u00a0 questions like:<br><br><ul><li>Does a particular method work correctly?</li><li>Does it terminate and, if yes, in what time?</li><li>Can we prove that a solution is optimal?</li></ul>The\n course starts by discussing what a linear program is and how linear programming can be \napplied. Then, we will treat the simplex method and the theory of \nduality. We will then discuss some combinatorial optimization problems like maximum weight bipartite matching and maximum flows.\u00a0<br><br>The\n course constitutes about half of the material on linear and discrete optimization \nthat is taught for mathematics and computer science undergraduates at \nEPFL and will feature video lectures, quizzes, programming assignments, \nand a final exam. <br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1a/c51aad6b5debccc8e5154afe2c039b/logo_big.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c6/0e72a56dfccc14d37aa099fac6ed12/logo_big.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4e/c1b71842848763186f164486340b59/logo_big.png","video":"YxFMBvBw54U","university-ids":["epfl"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/YxFMBvBw54U/","id":223,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/89/7f14b8c6f54b56a2446c99b2b8df86/EPFL_LOG_QUADRI_Red_resized.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"EPFL","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/142188830b51c8c51b95cc25e5dbf3/epflfav.png","website_facebook":"EPFL.ch","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/0a73c737b332745aac47797f57cda4/logo-epfl-front.png","background_color":"","id":16,"location_city":"Lausanne","location_country":"CH","location_lat":46.51996170000000000,"location":"Lausanne, Switzerland","primary_color":"#7E000C","abbr_name":"EPFL","website":"http://www.epfl.ch/","description":"","short_name":"epfl","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/22/b50d471bc34471c5a7c696b1d714cc/rolex_learning_center.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"user/epflnews","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ab/bb616e071f67f5bcaead9b67dbaa36/banner-epfl.jpg","location_state":"VD","name":"\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/01/a5c9c211331132096e7ba9942dbd51/square_epfl_400.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5f/f441e9c1630625018763c3b86cf582/square_epfl_400.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a7/fca9be507583b1f25e0fcd9fca0d59/square_epfl_400.svg","location_lng":6.63359709999997450,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"The course is an introduction to linear and discrete optimization - an important part of computational mathematics with a wide range of applications in many areas of everyday life.","description":"","short_name":"linearopt","target_audience":1,"faq":"<li><strong>Will I get a certificate for completing this class? </strong><br>Students who successfully complete the class (70% of assignments and final exam) will receive a certificate signed by the instructor.\u00a0</li><li><b>What resources will I need for the class? </b><br>For this course, all you need is an Internet\n connection, and the time to read and think.</li>\n<li><b>What are the prerequisites for this class? </b><br>The most important prerequisites are solid knowledge of linear algebra and some programming proficiency in a higher level programming language such as Java or Python.</li>","category-ids":["cs-theory","math"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"<ul><li>Linear programming, modeling, equivalence of standard forms </li><li>Basic solutions, primal and dual feasible basic solutions, pivoting and the simplex method</li><li>Termination and complexity of the simplex method </li><li>Integer programming, bipartite matching and flows</li><li>Models of computation, bit-complexity</li></ul><br>","course_format":"The\n class consists of lecture videos punctuated by quizzes.
