{"about_the_course":"General game players are computer systems able to play strategy games\nbased solely on formal game descriptions supplied at \"runtime\". &nbsp;(In\nother words, they don't know the rules until the game starts.) &nbsp;Unlike\nspecialized game players, such as Deep Blue, general game players cannot\nrely on algorithms designed in advance for specific games; they must discover\nsuch algorithms themselves. &nbsp;General game playing expertise depends\non intelligence on the part of the game player and not just intelligence\nof the programmer of the game player.\n<br>\n<br>\n<div>GGP is an interesting application in its own right. &nbsp;It is intellectually\n    engaging and more than a little fun. &nbsp;But it is much more than that.\n    &nbsp;It provides a theoretical framework for modeling discrete dynamic\n    systems and for defining rationality in a way that takes into account problem\n    representation and complexities like incompleteness of information and\n    resource bounds. &nbsp;It has practical applications in areas where these\n    features are important, e.g. in business and law. &nbsp;More fundamentally,\n    it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory\n    in which to evaluate competing approaches to artificial intelligence.</div>\n<br>This course is an introduction to General Game Playing (GGP). &nbsp;Students\nwill get an introduction to the theory of General Game Playing and will&nbsp;learn\nhow to create GGP programs capable of competing against other programs\nand humans.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0c/9f94be74f3fffc9dc21cc72f0a94b4/ggp.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/eee7cc8c0872c5e69bd0d6b7b6d81b/ggp.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/52/22e65c2ecc820ff1e6b0b42b789ab5/ggp.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["stanford"],"video_baseurl":"","id":297,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png","background_color":"","id":1,"location_city":"Palo Alto","location_country":"US","location_lat":37.44188340000000000,"location":"Palo Alto, CA, United States","primary_color":"#8C1515","abbr_name":"Stanford","website":"","description":"The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.","short_name":"stanford","landing_page_banner":"","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"","partner_type":1,"banner":"","location_state":"CA","name":"Stanford University","square_logo":"","square_logo_source":"","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-122.14301949999998000,"home_link":"http://online.stanford.edu/","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Learn about General Game Playing (GGP) and develop GGP programs capable of competing against humans and other programs in GGP competitions .","description":"","short_name":"ggp","target_audience":1,"faq":"","category-ids":["cs-theory","math","cs-ai"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"","course_format":"","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/eee7cc8c0872c5e69bd0d6b7b6d81b/ggp.jpg","suggested_readings":"","instructor":"Michael Genesereth","categories":[{"id":1,"name":"Computer Science: Theory","mailing_list_id":null,"short_name":"cs-theory","description":"Our wide range of courses allows students to explore topics from many different fields of study.
