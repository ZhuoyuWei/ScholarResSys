{"about_the_course":"Calculus is about the very large, the very small, and how things change.\u00a0 The surprise is that something seemingly so abstract ends up explaining the real world. \u00a0Calculus plays a starring role in the biological, physical, and social sciences.\u00a0 By focusing outside of the classroom, we will see examples of calculus appearing in daily life.<br><br>This course is a first and\u00a0friendly introduction to calculus, suitable for someone who has never seen the subject before, or for someone who has seen some calculus but wants to review the concepts and practice applying those concepts to solve problems.\u00a0 One learns calculus by doing calculus, and so this course encourages you to participate by providing you with:<br><br><ul><li>instant feedback on practice problems</li><li>interactive graphs and games for you to play</li><li>calculus projects and demos you can try at home</li><li>opportunities for you to explain your thought process</li></ul>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/78/c0178b527d61fb916f7759eba31125/calculus1.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/29/7babc8e901f719a87b96d201944fd6/calculus1.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fc/f9ebbb37faa8980a6279915601ef5b/calculus1.png","video":"Bt2xOpBRKMc","university-ids":["osu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/Bt2xOpBRKMc/","id":282,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"OhioState","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ae/1201e9f6249cafd6a532170780de3a/favicon-osu.png","website_facebook":"osu","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/fb97a1c3348fbf33a57859cc833585/preferred_red.png","background_color":"","id":28,"location_city":"Columbus","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.96117550000000000,"location":"Columbus, OH","primary_color":"#990000","abbr_name":"Ohio State","website":"http://www.osu.edu/","description":"The Ohio State University is one of the largest universities in the United States.
