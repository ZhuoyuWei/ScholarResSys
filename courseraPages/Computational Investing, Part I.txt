{"about_the_course":"<div><b>Overview<br></b>Why do the prices of some companies\u2019 stocks seem to move up and down together while others move separately? What does portfolio \u201cdiversification\u201d really mean and how important is it? What should the price of a stock be? How can we discover and exploit the relationships between equity prices automatically? We\u2019ll examine these questions, and others, from a computational point of view. You will learn many of the principles and algorithms hedge funds and investment professionals use to maximize return and reduce risk in equity portfolios.<br></div><div><br><b>Topics</b></div>We start with a tour of the mathematics and statistics that underlie equity price changes, and the relationships between different groups of equities. We\u2019ll review the most important economic theories of investing and how to create programs that take advantage of them. We\u2019ll look at the data needed to do this, and how to manipulate it effectively.&nbsp;Take a look at the course syllabus&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wiki.quantsoftware.org/index.php?title=Computational_Investing_I\">here</a>.<br><br><span><i>Important note:&nbsp;This is a&nbsp;project oriented course involving Python programming.<br></i><br><b>Be sure this course is right for you!</b><br>This course is intended for folks who have a strong programming background, but who are new to finance and investing. &nbsp;Check out the two links below to see if the course is a good match.<br><br></span><ul><li><span>Take a look at the course syllabus <a href=\"http://wiki.quantsoftware.org/index.php?title=Computational_Investing_I\" title=\"Link: http://wiki.quantsoftware.org/index.php?title=Computational_Investing_I\">here</a>.</span></li><li><span>Take a look at what other students thought of the course <a href=\"http://augmentedtrader.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/review-of-computational-investing-part-i-taught-by-tucker-balch/\">here</a>.</span></li></ul><span><b>Course options<br></b>You can enroll in the course in several ways:<br><br></span><ul><li><span><b>Regular enrollment. </b>In this track you are expected to watch the videos and&nbsp;complete the assignments.</span></li></ul><ul><li><b>Preview:</b> You can watch the videos without enrolling.
