{"about_the_course":"The impact of technology and networks on our lives, culture, and society continues to increase. The very fact that you can take this course from anywhere in the world requires a technological infrastructure that was designed, engineered, and built over the past sixty years. To function in an information-centric world, we need to understand the workings of network technology. This course will open up the Internet and show you how it was created, who created it and how it works. Along the way we will meet many of the innovators who developed the Internet and Web technologies that we use today. <br><br>\n<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>\nAfter this course you will not take the Internet and Web for granted. You will be better informed about important technological issues currently facing society. You will realize that the Internet and Web are spaces for innovation and you will get a better understanding of how you might fit into that innovation. If you get excited about the material in this course, it is a great lead-in to taking a course in Web design, Web development, programming, or even network administration. At a minimum, you will be a much wiser network citizen.<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/insidetheinternet/large-icon.png","preview_link":"https://class.coursera.org/insidetheinternet-004/lecture/preview","small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/insidetheinternet/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/insidetheinternet/large-icon.png","video":"E5rFiDmSPbY","university-ids":["umich"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/E5rFiDmSPbY/","id":42,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/75/07a2c2f614597144b29c9e63bbee75/U-M_Coursera_Logo-2.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"umich","china_mirror":3,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/50/52265d555e7bf0b0b86f7a1a07a183/favicon-umich.ico","website_facebook":"universityofmichigan","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99/263203c94842c44bcf757c4a801e8f/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":3,"location_city":"Ann Arbor","location_country":"US","location_lat":42.28082560000000000,"location":"Ann Arbor, MI","primary_color":"#002E5F","abbr_name":"Michigan","website":"http://www.umich.edu/","description":"The University of Michigan is a public research university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the United States.","short_name":"umich","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/70c6a457583d267a869cb6555b4de5/DIL-17Apr12_AT150a_EDIT_TO_2.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"user/um","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/36/1d953d8380a15d8eb0d307c7cde0bb/banner-umich.jpg","location_state":"MI","name":"University of Michigan","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/70/de505d47be7d3a063b51b6f856a6e2/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/26/23ecbedd1043250eab7d1b0a41696b/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6b/fce84d27ebcd493f839f14df253541/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_.svg","location_lng":-83.74303780000002000,"home_link":"","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/05/1a1f4b975bf71dba0ac79042ed651e/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_200x48.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"What is the Internet?

How to we secure communications on the Internet?","description":"","short_name":"insidetheinternet","target_audience":0,"faq":"<ul>\n    <li><strong>Why history?</strong>\n\n        <p>This is not history just to memorize dates, places, and people's names\n            so you can answer questions on an exam. The history of the Internet and\n            the Web is not nearly as simple as it might seem on the surface. There\n            are heroes who saved the day and villains who tried to keep the heroes\n            from saving the day. There were complex engineering issues that needed\n            to be solved in a hurry. By looking at what really happened and hearing\n            directly from those who built it, we also learn about how humans work together\n            to solve large, complex, and undefined problems.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>What is the format of the class?</strong>\n\n        <p>The course is about 60% recorded lectures and 40% video interviews with\n            Internet pioneers. It will be comprised of a series of 10-30 minute segments\n            with some assessment material at the end of each segment. You should expect\n            to spend 2-5 hours per week viewing the material, doing extra readings,\n            participating in discussions with fellow students, and taking the assessments.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Do I need a textbook?</strong>\n\n        <p>No. The materials are mostly self-contained and extra materials will be\n            available on the Web or available for free from within the course.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Will we need to write programs?</strong>\n\n        <p>No. No programs. Trust me. No programs.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>What about timing? Can I take this self-paced?</strong>\n\n        <p>Sort of. Within any week of the course, you can look at the material and\n            take assessments whenever you have time available, regardless of your time\n            zone. But we will move the course along and there will be due dates for\n            each assessment to keep us all moving forward together. So you can't wait\n            until the last week and do all the material in a day or two. We expect\n            that you will be committed and work on the course each week as you would\n            for any other college class.</p>\n    </li>\n   <li><strong>What is the Twitter hash tag for the course?</strong>\n    <p> The has tag for this course is <strong>#IHTS</strong> you can see what\n          students are talking about for the class <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ihts\" target=\"_blank\">Search IHTS on Twitter</a>.\n          </p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Can we contact the professor?</strong>\n\n        <p>The professor will be nearby and monitoring the course. If problems come\n            up, there may be a need for online office hours or even the just-in-time\n            development of extra materials if a lot of students get stuck on a particular\n            topic or idea. The discussion forum is an important part of the class and\n            your fellow students will answer many questions. Teaching staff will monitor\n            and interact in the forums as well. You can follow the instructor on Twitter\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/drchuck\">@drchuck</a>\u00a0to get a sense of where he is during the course.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Do we need to know HTML?</strong>\n\n        <p>No. But after you take this course, we hope you get inspired to want to\n            learn HTML.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment\u00a0after completing this class?</strong>\n\n        <p>Yes.
