{"about_the_course":"<p>Each of our cells contains nearly identical copies of our genome, which provides instructions that allow us to develop and function. The field of Genomics focuses on the structure and function of genomes and plays a major and increasing role in both medicine and research. This course serves as an introduction to the main laboratory and theoretical aspects of genomics and is divided into themes: genomes, genetics, functional genomics, systems biology, single cell approaches, proteomics, and applications. We start with the basics, DNA sequencing and the genome project, then move to high throughput sequencing methods and applications. Next we introduce principles of genetics and then apply them in clinical genetics and other large-scale sequencing projects. In the functional genomics unit, we start with RNA expression dynamics, analysis of alternative splicing, epigenomics and ChIP-seq, and metagenomics. Model organisms and forward and reverse genetics screens are then discussed, along with quantitative trait locus (QTL) and eQTL analysis. After that, we introduce integrative and single cell genomics approaches and systems biology. Finally, we conclude by introducing in applying proteomic approaches.</p><div><br></div>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/genomescience/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/genomescience/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/genomescience/large-icon.png","video":"WTvntDF4XL8","university-ids":["penn"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/WTvntDF4XL8/","id":44,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/14/c965e1f5cf9ead221ad770bd907f3a/Penn-logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"pennopencourses","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png","background_color":"","id":6,"location_city":"Philadelphia","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.95233500000000000,"location":"Philadelphia, PA","primary_color":"#0000FF","abbr_name":"Penn","website":"http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning","description":"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

In his thesis work, he discovered five novel mammalian members of the bHLH-PAS family, termed MOP1-5 for members of PAS superfamily (Hogenesch et al., JBC, 1997). Characterization revealed one of the orphans, MOP3, was the partner of a related bHLH-PAS member, Clock, a master regulator of circadian (Hogenesch, et. al, PNAS, 1998). This circuitry comprises the molecular basis of circadian rhythmicity in mammals. To build on these interests, in 1999 he joined the laboratory of Steve Kay at the Scripps Research Institute and the Novartis Research Foundation as a postdoctoral fellow. At GNF, he worked on the assembly of the complete mammalian transcriptomes (Hogenesch et al., Cell, 2001), as well as on the mRNA characterization of their expression (Su et al, PNAS 2002; Su et al., PNAS, 2004). Current interests include the development of genome wide methodologies for the study of cellular pathways using cDNAs and siRNAs (Conkright et al., Molecular Cell, 2003; Sato et al, Neuron, 2004 ; Willingham et al., Science, 2005; Sato et al., Nature Genetics, 2006). In 2006, Dr. Hogenesch joined the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He is now Professor of Pharmacology, Director of the Penn Center for Bioinformatics, and Associate Director of the Penn Genome Frontiers Institute.\n<p><img width=\"150\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/genomescience/instructor-2.jpg\" height=\"203\" style=\"width: 200px;\" class=\"coursera-instructor-thumb\"> </p><p><a href=\"http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8377794\">John Isaac Murray</a> did his graduate work in Genetics with David Botstein at Stanford University. He worked on several projects, including the genome-wide characterization of stress responsive and cell cycle regulated genes in human cells, and in defining gene expression signatures of the autoimmune disease Scleroderma. His work on stress responses identified highly distinct gene expression responses to different types of stress in a single cell type, and to the same stress in different cell types. To extend this type of expression analysis to an in vivo setting, he joined the laboratory of Robert Waterston in the University of Washington department of Genome Sciences. There, he developed automated microscopy based methods to allow the single-cell resolution measurement of gene expression in developing embryos of the nematode C. elegans, a major model organism. Applying these methods to define expression patterns at high resolution for a large collection of transcription factors identified novel mechanisms and important regulators of developmental fate specification, which Dr. Murray is now studying in his own laboratory. Since 2010 he has been Assistant Professor of Genetics at the Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania and a core member of the Penn Genome Frontiers Institute.</p>","university_logo":"","course-ids":[138,970486],"display":true,"recommended_background":""}
