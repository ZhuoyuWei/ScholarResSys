{"about_the_course":"This course is designed to provide knowledge of equine digestion and nutrition for those with an interest in this area. The anatomy and physiology of the equine alimentary canal will be studied to provide students with an understanding of the equine digestive system. \u00a0Nutrient sources for horses will be discussed, with emphasis placed on the health and welfare issues surrounding the inclusion of various types of feedstuffs in equine diets. \u00a0Students will also discuss recommendations on rations for horses and ponies performing various activities and should feel better equipped to make judgements on rations for horses and ponies, in health and disease.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/equinenutrition/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/equinenutrition/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/equinenutrition/large-icon.png","video":"2Tm8Dp8QeiI","university-ids":["edinburgh"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/2Tm8Dp8QeiI/","id":110,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/6f0cac699523103808a9303765f54e/UoE-vector-side-align.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UniofEdinburgh","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d3/bcdd33b2d979d2bea9467b17f9bbbb/favicon-edinburgh.ico","website_facebook":"UniversityOfEdinburgh","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7f/781467d4f282293bb644ca68683509/UoE-Logo-200x48-Left-Centred-Text-Trans-v3.png","background_color":"","id":14,"location_city":"Edinburgh","location_country":"GB","location_lat":55.95325200000000000,"location":"Edinburgh, United Kingdom","primary_color":"#002675","abbr_name":"Edinburgh","website":"http://www.ed.ac.uk/","description":"Delivering excellence in teaching and learning. \n\nConsistently ranked as one of the world's top 50 universities and top 3 UK provider of online Masters courses.

Learning materials will be provided on various feedstuffs utilised in equine diets. \u00a0These various nutrient sources for horses will be discussed, with emphasis placed on the health and welfare issues surrounding the inclusion of various types of feedstuffs in horse diets. Discussions should involve considering how nutrients are digested within the gastrointestinal tract and how knowledge of this can enhance the dietary management of equids to ensure good health, maximise performance and prevent nutrition-related diseases/disorders. <br><br> <b>Week 4: Equine dietary management</b><br> This week of the course will explore the nutrient requirements of equids and the dietary management of these animals. Discussions should focus around considering how modern feeding practices do not always consider the anatomy and physiology of the equid digestive tract. <br><br> <b>Week 5: Equine clinical nutrition</b><br> This part of the course will focus on evaluating feeding strategies for the management and prevention of some nutrition-related diseases/disorders in equids; for example, obesity, laminitis, older horses with dental issues etc. Discussions should focus on the dietary management of individuals affected with nutrition-related problems.","course_format":"<div>The course will consist of 5 weeks of video lectures of approximately 1 hour in total (broken down into videos of between 10 and 20 minutes in length). \u00a0There will also be supporting notes and additional readings provided. \u00a0 There will be quiz questions throughout the course to test your knowledge and understanding of the learning materials along with optional quiz assessments, should you wish to complete these.</div>\n<div></div>","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/equinenutrition/small-icon.hover.png","suggested_readings":"<div>Although the course is designed to be self-contained, students who are looking to expand their knowledge beyond what is covered in the course will find further information in the following texts:</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\u2022 FRAPE D. 2010. <a href=\"http://www.tqlkg.com/click-7115529-10692263?sid=equinenutrition&URL=http://www.chegg.com/textbooks/9781405195461\">Equine Nutrition and Feeding</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=coursera-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1405195460\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"> Longman Scientific, UK.</div>\n<div>\u2022 HILL, J.
