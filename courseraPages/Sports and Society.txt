{"about_the_course":"Sports play a giant role in contemporary society worldwide. But\nfew of us pause to think about the larger questions of money, politics,\nrace, sex, culture, and commercialization that surround sports everywhere. This course draws on the tools of anthropology, sociology, history,\nand other disciplines to give you new perspectives on the games we watch\nand play. We will focus on both popular sports like soccer (or \u201cfootball,\u201d\nas anyone outside America calls it), basketball, and baseball, and also\nlesser-known ones like mountain-climbing and fishing.
