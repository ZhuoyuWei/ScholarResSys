{"about_the_course":"<p>As\nindividuals we are defined by relationships, by our connection to people,\nplaces, and things. Such connectedness can be not only emotional and erotic but\nalso political, environmental, and even textual, enacted through writing. In\nthis course we explore the nature and meaning of such connections in ten&nbsp;major works of narrative fiction from the 18th century to the\npresent. These include: <i>Manon Lescaut</i> by Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost; two works by Herman Melville, <i>Bartleby the Scrivener </i>and <i>Benito Cereno</i>; Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s <i>Jane Eyre</i> and two stories by Franz\nKafka, \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d and \u201cThe Country Doctor\u201d;\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s <i>To the Lighthouse</i>\nand William Faulkner\u2019s <i>Light in August</i>;&nbsp; an anthology of stories, <i>Ficciones</i>, by Jorge Luis\nBorges and <i>The Ice Palace </i>by Tarjei\nVesaas; Tony Morrison\u2019s <i>Beloved</i> and <i>Disgrace</i> by J.M. Coetzee.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As this course will demonstrate, the most\ncritical relationships in our lives\u2014the comings and goings that define us\u2014are\nnot always easy to get a fix on, but literature offers us a special sighting on\nthese arrangements. Through exploratory readings of these narrative works, the\ncourse will seek to make relationship visible, bringing our traffic with the\nworld and with others into clearer focus.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c7/b27f6a5649fa2f53df09e13aff8bbd/fictionimage_weinstein_rev.jpeg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/90/6e08b99ecc07abd5547eb019447dda/fictionimage_weinstein_rev.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3f/b40640ec5e587fae24709f71824e9a/fictionimage_weinstein_rev.jpg","video":"ssu8GN8UHhM","university-ids":["brown"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/ssu8GN8UHhM/","id":204,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"BrownUniversity","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/54/51fc6594a22ce0fcd31168f109900f/5_brown_icon_coursera.jpg","website_facebook":"BrownUniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1e/b5f0ff349ddbf16b116d9a181c9552/Coursera_CourseTopLeftLogo_Brown.png","background_color":"","id":22,"location_city":"Providence","location_country":"US","location_lat":41.82398910000000000,"location":"Providence, RI","primary_color":"#C00404","abbr_name":"Brown","website":"http://www.brown.edu/","description":"Founded in 1764, Brown University is an independent, coeducational Ivy League institution.
