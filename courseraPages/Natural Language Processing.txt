{"about_the_course":"<p>This course covers a broad range of topics in natural language processing, including word and sentence tokenization, text classification and sentiment analysis, spelling correction, information extraction, parsing, meaning extraction, and question answering, We will also introduce the underlying theory from probability, statistics, and machine learning that are crucial for the field, and cover fundamental algorithms like n-gram language modeling, naive bayes and maxent classifiers, sequence models like Hidden Markov Models, probabilistic dependency and constituent parsing, and vector-space models of meaning.</p>\nWe are offering this course on Natural Language Processing free and online to students worldwide, continuing Stanford's exciting forays into large scale online instruction. Students have access to screencast lecture videos, are given quiz questions, assignments and exams, receive regular feedback on progress, and can participate in a discussion forum. Those who successfully complete the course will receive a statement of accomplishment. Taught by Professors Jurafsky and Manning, the curriculum draws from Stanford's courses in Natural Language Processing. You will need a decent internet connection for accessing course materials, but should be able to watch the videos on your smartphone.&nbsp;<br><br>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/nlp/large-icon.png","preview_link":"https://class.coursera.org/nlp/lecture/preview","small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/nlp/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/nlp/large-icon.png","video":"Fnr4A0tcU-M","university-ids":["stanford"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/Fnr4A0tcU-M/","id":7,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png","background_color":"","id":1,"location_city":"Palo Alto","location_country":"US","location_lat":37.44188340000000000,"location":"Palo Alto, CA, United States","primary_color":"#8C1515","abbr_name":"Stanford","website":"","description":"The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.","short_name":"stanford","landing_page_banner":"","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"","partner_type":1,"banner":"","location_state":"CA","name":"Stanford University","square_logo":"","square_logo_source":"","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-122.14301949999998000,"home_link":"http://online.stanford.edu/","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"In this class, you will learn fundamental algorithms and mathematical models for processing natural language, and how these can be used to solve practical problems.","description":"","short_name":"nlp","target_audience":1,"faq":"<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

In the past decade, successful natural language processing applications have become part of our everyday experience, from spelling and grammar correction in word processors to machine translation on the web, from email spam detection to automatic question answering, from detecting people's opinions about products or services to extracting appointments from your email. In this class, you'll learn the fundamental algorithms and mathematical models for human language processing and how you can use them to solve practical problems in dealing with language data wherever you encounter it.</li>\n</ul>","category-ids":["cs-ai"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"<p>The following topics will be covered in the first two weeks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Introduction and Overview:</b></li>\n<li><b>Basic Text Processing:&nbsp;</b>J+M Chapters 2.1, 3.9; MR+S Chapters 2.1-2.2</li>\n<li><b>Minimum Edit Distance:&nbsp;</b>J+M Chapter 3.11</li>\n<li><b>Language Modeling:&nbsp;</b>J+M Chapter 4</li>\n<li><b>Spelling Correction:</b>&nbsp;J+M Chapters 5.9,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html\">Peter Norvig (2007) How to Write a Spelling Corrector</a></li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"coursera-course-faq\"></div>","course_format":"","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/nlp/small-icon.hover.png","suggested_readings":"<p>We will provide detailed lecture notes of all the technical content, which will be yours to keep after the end of class.
