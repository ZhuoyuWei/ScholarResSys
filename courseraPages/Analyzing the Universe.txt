{"about_the_course":"<span> Science is really not about looking up facts in an encyclopedia.\u00a0 It is a <i>process</i> that\nextends what we know into the realm of the unexplored.\u00a0 This can be\nexciting, certainly; to be able to sneak a peek at the Universe at its strange,\nawesome, cosmic best.\u00a0 But it is very different from your run-of-the-mill\nstandard \u201ctextbook\u201d idea of science.\u00a0 Science is a social, human endeavor.<br></span><br><span>And as human beings, we crave authenticity.\u00a0 We have seen the trappings of\nsociety, we act as if we have mastered technology, and yet we know that\nsomething is lacking.\u00a0 We have succumbed to the lure of Ebay, Facebook and\nAmazon (at least, I know <u>I</u> have!), and yet we remain unsatisfied at some primal level.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s time to peel away the layers of glitzy imagery and use our machines to exploit their ultimate purpose: the capability to\u00a0 process large amounts\nof data with instructions that we provide, in order to test our ideas about how\nthe Universe seems to behave.\u00a0 In short, to do Science.</span><span>\u00a0 For the\nfirst time, it is possible for the interested student (and we are <u>all</u>\nstudents, <u>especially</u> those that have any claim to be considered\n\u201clearned\u201d , such as the instructor!) to have this experience on-line. <br><br></span><p>The subject matter for this course will be divided into two\nbroad components which will be interwoven in an interdisciplinary fashion. The first is a general introduction to the physics and astronomy\ninformation you will need to understand basic phenomena that occur in the realm\nof x-ray astrophysics; the second is the presentation of authentic satellite\ndata from various exciting types of x-ray sources, which you will analyze to\nbetter understand the working of the high-energy Universe in which we live.\nThere are no prerequisites for this course, other than high-school mathematics\n(algebra and trigonometry).<br></p><p> I hope you will enjoy your experience in \"Analyzing the Universe\".</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/69/c0e0fa7afe31813d3322a2b3007937/supernova-black-hole.jpg","preview_link":"https://class.coursera.org/analyze-001/lecture/preview","small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/22/26e686620527dc5aa46036d2915047/supernova-black-hole.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e0/0ca6c0356518a9bb53d5de418c54db/supernova-black-hole.jpg","video":"VfSumhQblEM","university-ids":["rutgers"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/VfSumhQblEM/","id":462,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"","logo":"","background_color":"","id":67,"location_city":"New Brunswick","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.49786230000000000,"location":"83 Somerset St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901","primary_color":"","abbr_name":"Rutgers","website":"http://www.rutgers.edu/","description":"","short_name":"rutgers","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/59/a107424bb3b0befa13a7cdd26a9a67/1280320px-v2.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"","partner_type":1,"banner":"","location_state":"NJ","name":"Rutgers University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2a/5d3c520f1aeb9edfb86a3acbbda9b1/360px.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/23e841ad9082e89831838b9065dac1/360px.jpg","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-74.44636279999997000,"home_link":"","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/35/06793b9429f2bb7fa481c88824dadf/200px48px.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Using publicly available data from NASA of actual satellite observations of astronomical  x-ray sources, we explore some of the mysteries of the cosmos, including neutron stars, black holes, quasars and supernovae.","description":"","short_name":"analyze","target_audience":0,"faq":"","category-ids":["physics"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"","course_format":"","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/22/26e686620527dc5aa46036d2915047/supernova-black-hole.jpg","suggested_readings":"","instructor":"Terry A.
