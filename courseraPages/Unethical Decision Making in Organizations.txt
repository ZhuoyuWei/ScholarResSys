{"about_the_course":"Whenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behavior in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people (so-called bad apples). However, numerous corporate scandals, such as Enron, Ford, or Siemens, have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a corrupt context. Good apples may become rotten in bad barrels. Regardless of their good intentions and strong values, individual actors might adapt to the unethical practices in their respective organizational context and, over time, lose the ability to see their wrongdoings. They become ethically blind. Such changes in people\u2019s way of seeing the world and their value systems can occur in\u2014and through\u2014various organizational contexts in business, civil society, and public administration. This course is not about apples but about barrels and barrel makers. A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.<br><br>The goal of this course is to empower students to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It will draw from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course will also analyze some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ff/079482ccced35e86a8a9ea70e0c0e4/Biz_ethics_Fotolia_49499572.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ee/e13e8b77ce3a83e40b18a55456954d/Biz_ethics_Fotolia_49499572.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/64/7fca1dd6a137cd9008017e4cd55bfa/Biz_ethics_Fotolia_49499572.png","video":"","university-ids":["unil"],"video_baseurl":"","id":1153,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/9d/f1faf4ba8b9e67265ff0b332ac74bd/UNIL_Logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"unil","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5d/35b7304f658744775e0f2a0ba8927f/Logo_UNIL_16x16.png","website_facebook":"unil.ch","logo":"","background_color":"","id":159,"location_city":"Lausanne","location_country":"CH","location_lat":46.52252989999999000,"location":"Dorigny, Lausanne, Switzerland","primary_color":"#4391CC","abbr_name":"UNIL","website":"http://www.unil.ch/","description":"The University of Lausanne is a Swiss state university founded in 1537.
