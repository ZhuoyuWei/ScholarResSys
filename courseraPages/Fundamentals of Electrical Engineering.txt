{"about_the_course":"<div>The course focuses on the creation, manipulation, transmission, and reception of information by electronic means. The topics covered include elementary signal theory; time- and frequency-domain analysis of signals; conversion of analog signals to a digital form; and how information can be represented with signals. Signal processing, both analog and digital, allow information to be extracted and manipulated. The course then turns to information theory, which demonstrates the technological advantages of digital transmission.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The course text was written by the instructor for this course and is entirely online.

Johnson is the J.S. Abercrombie Professor Emeritus of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice University, Houston, Texas. He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees in electrical engineering, all from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory as a staff member in 1974 and then, in 1977, he joined the faculty of Rice University. At MIT and at Rice, he received several institution-wide teaching awards, including Rice\u2019s highest award, the George R. Brown Award for Excellence in Teaching. Professor Johnson is a Fellow of the IEEE, a recipient of the IEEE Millennium Medal and the Signal Processing Society\u2019s Meritorious Service Award, and former President of the Signal Processing Society. He co-authored the graduate-level book Array Signal Processing, published in 1993, and holds nine patents. His present research activities concern art forensic analysis from x-ray images of paintings and statistical signal processing. Since 2011, he is an Adjunct Research Fellow of the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.</div>\n<div></div>","university_logo":"","course-ids":[296,971481],"display":true,"recommended_background":"Knowledge of Calculus"}
