Topics include\n            depth-first search, breadth-first search, topological sort, Kosaraju-Sharir,\n            Kruskal, Prim, Dijkistra, Bellman-Ford, Ford-Fulkerson, LSD radix sort,\n            MSD radix sort, 3-way radix quicksort, multiway tries, ternary search tries,\n            Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, Rabin-Karp, >regular expression matching,\n            run-length coding, Huffman coding, LZW compression, and the Burrows-Wheeler\n            transform.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Are there any associated resources available on the web?</strong>\n\n        <p>Yes. Our free<a href=\"http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu\" target=\"_blank\"> booksite</a> contains\n            synopses of the text, web exercises, Java implementations of all the algorithms\n            covered (any many more) that are designed for you to be able to download\n            and use with one click, test data, and many other resources.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>How does this course differ from Design and Analysis of Algorithms?</strong>\n\n        <p>The two courses are complementary. This one is essentially a programming\n            course that concentrates on developing code; that one is essentially a\n            math course that concentrates on understanding proofs. This course is about\n            learning algorithms in the context of implementing and testing them in\n            practical applications; that one is about learning algorithms in the context\n            of developing mathematical models that help explain why they are efficient.\n            In typical computer science curriculums, a course like this one is taken\n            by first- and second-year students and a course like that one is taken\n            by juniors and seniors.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>I am/was not a computer science major. Is this course for me?</strong>\n\n        <p>Yes. This course is for anyone using a computer to address large problems\n            (and therefore needing efficient algorithms). At Princeton, over 25% of\n            all students take the course, including people majoring in engineering,\n            biology, physics, chemistry, economics, and many other fields, not just\n            computer science.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>If I have no familiarity with Java programming, can I still take the course?\n        </strong>\n        <p>Our central thesis is that algorithms are best understood by implementing\n            and testing them. Our use of Java is essentially expository, and we shy\n            away from exotic features, so we expect you would be able to adapt our\n            code to your favorite language. However, we require that you submit the\n            programming assignments in Java. If you have some experience programming\n            in another language, you might find it worthwhile to learn our programming\n            model by studying our book An Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary\n            Approach and associated free <a href=\"http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu\" target=\"_blank\">booksite</a>.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>If I have not programmed before, can I still take the course?\n        </strong>\n        <p>Probably not.</p>\n        <p></p>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Does Princeton University award credentials or reports regarding my work in this course?</strong>\n     \n        <p>No certificates, statements of accomplishment, or other credentials will\n            be awarded in connection with this course.</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>","category-ids":["cs-theory","cs-programming"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"","course_format":"There will be two lectures (75 minutes each) each week.
