{"about_the_course":"<p>About 2 million years ago our human\nancestors were&nbsp;insignificant animals living in a corner of Africa.

Our species, <i>Homo\nsapiens</i>, was just one among them. Who were the others? Where did they come\nfrom? And what happened to them? Why is there today only one species of humans\u2014<i>Homo\nsapiens</i>?</p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 2: The Cognitive\nRevolution</b></p>\n\n<p>The Cognitive Revolution, about\n70,000 years ago, enabled <i>Homo sapiens</i> to conquer the world and drive\nall other human species to extinction. During this revolution, <i>Homo sapiens</i>\ndeveloped a new and remarkable kind of language. How was this language\ndifferent from the languages of earlier human species and of other animals? What\nwere the advantages that <i>Homo sapiens</i> gained from this unique language? </p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 3: Daily Life in the\nStone Age</b></p>\n\n<p>What was life like for people who\nlived 30,000 years ago? What did they do when they woke up in the morning? How\ndid they organize their societies? Did they have monogamous relationships and\nnuclear families? Did they have religions, revolutions, and wars?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 4: The Human Flood</b></p>\n\n<p>Following the Cognitive Revolution,\n<i>Homo sapiens</i> spread all over the planet. While doing this, it drove\nnumerous other species to extinction. In Australia, up to 95% of all large\nanimal species vanished. In America,\n84 of 107 large mammal species disappeared. Altogether, about half of the large\nterrestrial mammals that populated Earth became extinct. How could a few\nmillion individuals who possessed no more than Stone Age technology have caused\nsuch devastation?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b><i>Part II: The Agricultural Revolution </i></b></p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 5: History\u2019s Biggest\nFraud</b></p>\n\n<p>About 12,000 years ago, people in\nthe Middle East, China, and Central America began domesticating plants and animals.\nIn the process, <i>Homo sapiens</i><span>,<i>\n</i></span>too, was domesticated, abandoning a life of hunting and gathering\nfor the pleasures and discomforts of agriculture. For most people, the\ndiscomforts outweighed the pleasures. The Agricultural Revolution made the life\nof the average person harder. Why, then, did it occur?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 6: Building Pyramids</b></p>\n\n<p>For millions of years, humans lived\nin intimate bands of no more than a few dozen individuals. Our biological\ninstincts are adapted to this way of life. Humans are consequently ill-equipped\nto cooperate with large numbers of strangers. Yet shortly after the Agricultural\nRevolution erupted, humans established cities, kingdoms, and huge empires. How\ndid they do it? How can millions of strangers agree on shared laws, norms and\nvalues?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 7: There is No Justice\nin History </b></p>\n\n<p>A critical factor in the formation\nof complex societies was the division of the population into a hierarchy of\ngroups. Agricultural and industrial societies have been built on hierarchies of\nclass, race, ethnicity, and gender. Why was it impossible to create a just and\nequal society? What is the deep root of prejudice and injustice? In particular,\nwhy did almost all known societies treat men as superior to women? </p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b><i>Part III: The Unification of Humankind</i></b></p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 8: The Direction of History\n</b></p>\n\n<p>After the Agricultural Revolution,\nhumans created many different cultures and societies. The relations between\nthese different societies were very complex, and involved wars and conflicts as\nwell as trade, immigration and imitation. But as time went by, the connections\nbetween the societies became stronger and stronger, so that humankind was\ngradually united into a single global society. Three main forces shaped this\nprocess of unification. The first was money and trade. Money is the most\nuniversal system of mutual trust ever devised by humans. How come even people\nwho believe in different gods and obey rival kings, are nevertheless willing to\nuse the same money?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 9: Imperial Visions</b></p>\n\n<p>The second force that shaped the\nprocess of human unification is imperialism. The idea of empire is seen today\nin a very negative light, but empires have played such a central role in human\nhistory that it\u2019s hard to regard them as totally evil. What exactly is an\nempire? How have empires succeeded in uniting under their control different\necological regions, ethnic groups, and religious communities? How can we\nbalance the positive contribution of empires with their record of violence and\noppression? And what is the future of the imperial ideal? Is the world destined\nto be ruled by a new global empire?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 10: The Law of Religion</b></p>\n\n<p>The third force that shaped the\nprocess of human unification is religion. The role of religion in history is\nextremely controversial. Some see religion as the root of all evil, while for\nothers it is the primary source of happiness, empathy, and progress. Can we\narrive at a balanced judgment? What were the main landmarks in the religious\nhistory of the world? In what ways did different cultures understand the\nuniverse, distinguish good from evil, and explain the ubiquitous presence of\nsuffering?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b><i>Part IV. The Scientific Revolution</i></b></p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 11: The Discovery of\nIgnorance</b></p>\n\n<p>During the last 500 years the\nprocess of human unification was completed. At the same time, there has been an\nexplosive growth in the power of humankind, due above all to the discoveries of\nmodern science. Humankind has become increasingly convinced that the only thing\nthat limits its power is its own ignorance, and that the discovery of new\nknowledge can enable it to do almost anything. How is the modern scientific\ntradition different from all previous traditions of knowledge? What accounts\nfor its sudden rise and for its unparalleled achievements? </p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 12: The Marriage of\nScience and Empire</b></p>\n\n<p>Modern science developed in\nalliance with the modern European empires. The conquest of new knowledge\ndepended upon and made possible the conquest of new territories. What exactly\nwas the contribution of science to the rise of the European empires, and what\nwas the contribution of the European empires to the development of science? And\nwhy did it all start in Europe, rather than in China,\nIndia, or the Middle East? </p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 13: The Capitalist Creed</b></p>\n\n<p>The close ties between science and\nimperialism were in fact just one part of a more complex relationship. The\nthird crucial member of this relationship was capitalism, which financed both\nscience and empire, and which led to an unprecedented growth in the world\neconomy. How does a capitalist economy function? How is it different from traditional\neconomies? Is capitalism natural, or is it really a kind of religion?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 14: The Industrial\nRevolution</b></p>\n\n<p>During the last 200 years, the\ncombination of science, imperialism and capitalism produced the Industrial\nRevolution. This revolution gave humankind control of enormous new energy\nresources, and enabled humankind to start manufacturing far more things than\never before, far more quickly, and far more cheaply. How did this change the\nglobal ecology, daily life, and human psychology?</p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 15: A Permanent\nRevolution</b></p>\n\n<p>The Industrial Revolution opened an\nera of permanent revolution. The late modern socio-political order is constantly\nchanging, never settling into any stable pattern. The pillars of human\norder\u2014most notably, the family and the intimate community\u2014are crumbling around\nus. How do humans deal with the resulting vacuum and chaos? How do society and\npolitics function without stability? Is the world becoming more violent and\ndangerous, or is it actually more peaceful and secure than ever before? </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 16: And They Lived\nHappily Ever After </b></p>\n\n<p>Have 500 years of amazing discoveries,\ndevelopments, and revolutions made people happier? Are people today happier\nthan in the Middle Ages, or in the Stone Age? If not, what was the point of all\nthese changes? Most history books ignore these issues, yet these are the most\nimportant questions we can ask about history. New studies in biology,\neconomics, and psychology are offering fascinating insights into the history of\nhuman happiness.</p>\n\n<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Lecture 17: The End of <i>Homo Sapiens</i>\n</b></p>\n\n<p>Over the last few decades humans\nhave began to bend and break the laws of natural selection\u2014laws that have\ngoverned life on Earth for the past four billion years. New technologies such\nas genetic engineering and nanotechnology are giving us unprecedented abilities\nto design not only the world around us, but also our own bodies, our\npersonalities, and our desires. How will this influence society and culture?\nDoes anybody know where we are heading?
