{"about_the_course":"<p>Universities, and higher education systems worldwide, are being transformed\n    by new or changing practices, programs, policies, and agendas. From notions\n    of \u2018global competency\u2019 and the \u2018global engineer,\u2019 through to ever more\n    common perceptions that international collaborative research is a desirable\n    objective, through to the phenomena of bibliometrics, rankings and benchmarking\n    that work at a global scale, contexts are changing.</p>\n<p>This course is designed to help students better understand the complex\n    and rapidly changing nature of higher education and research in a globalizing\n    era. A complementary objective is to experiment with the MOOC platform\n    and assess how well it works to support international collaborative teaching\n    and service. We decided to participate in this initiative to engage in\n    some \u2018learning while doing\u2019 that will build on our experiences in international\n    collaborative research, advising, and teaching, as well as Kris\u2019 experience\n    at UW-Madison with a relative new online course (Geography 340 \u2013 World\n    Regions in Global Context).</p>\n<p>Professors Olds and Robertson began collaborating via a Worldwide Universities\n    Network (WUN) exchange scheme in the mid-2000s. The University of Bristol\n    and University of Wisconsin-Madison are both members of the WUN. We very\n    much look forward to engaging with you about this topic.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/33/5423a2bd882cf11b84f5a7d5ae4957/TwitterAvatar.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/18/51bebaa24f4e80852f271d5498d998/TwitterAvatar.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ca/74dfc7e9fe83fc00f4f37878a6e030/TwitterAvatar.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["wisconsin","bristol"],"video_baseurl":"","id":427,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"uwmadison","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e4/4fd5046adaccc8414bb742946bcdba/uwcrest_web_sm_shado.png","website_facebook":"uwmadison","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/0f/43d679f16be0150327575eb2440f1e/UWlogo_fl_4c.png","background_color":"","id":65,"location_city":"Madison","location_country":"US","location_lat":43.07305170000000000,"location":"Madison, WI","primary_color":"#B70101","abbr_name":"UW-Madison","website":"http://www.wisc.edu/","description":"In achievement and prestige, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison has long been recognized as one of America's great universities.
