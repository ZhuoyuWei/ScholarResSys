{"about_the_course":"This course will teach the student how to survive when everything we normally\ntake for granted is gone, when the structures we depend on have failed.\nWe will examine the Disaster Cycle, particularly the Mitigation and Recovery\nphases. Students will prepare an extensive personal preparedness plan covering\nsuch topics as supplies, communication, food and water, shelter, security,\nand comfort (yes even in survival there can and should be comfort). We\nalso look at preparedness on the institutional and government levels.\n<br>\n<br>We will look beyond these plans towards the one aspect of survival, which\nwill enable a person to survive when all planning has failed. Disasters,\nby definition, overwhelm all available resources. If all available resources\nare gone, only one thing will keep a person alive and that is their attitude.\nA persons awareness and attitude, the two are closely linked, allow a person\nthe means to remain calm, avoid panic, and draw upon resources within and\noutside the person to survive when their world has failed. In truth not\neveryone survives in extreme circumstances; people die, but, even in death,\nattitude, if it cannot save you, provides some degree or comfort.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0e/ba15c5e2d53d2d7556a7605bcb7361/MP900401427.JPG","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3c/7386d7914d0c4e872a68b809d1f3d1/MP900401427.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/30/288f2ce285db9e912a165a75a55cca/MP900401427.jpg","video":"eF8wTi1FkN0","university-ids":["pitt"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/eF8wTi1FkN0/","id":165,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"PittTweet","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/00/ee7a228aa46a231152d55b9bb9d0ae/logo_16x16.png","website_facebook":"UPitt","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/79/17cec4653cf480709f1e1387174c10/course_logo_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":36,"location_city":"Pittsburgh","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.44062479999999000,"location":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","primary_color":"#211C51","abbr_name":"Pittsburgh","website":"http://www.pitt.edu/","description":"Leader in Education | Pioneer in Research | Partner in Regional Development","short_name":"pitt","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/9f0fef78e7139d3b7b13241df58529/banner-edit.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"pittweb","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/a20a6bc0497aff000b698a477aebba/banner_928x220.jpg","location_state":"PA","name":"University of Pittsburgh","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/05df639c8e1a3ff7617e1997f0feae/pittseal360x360-edit.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e7/eaadeaf0338f3f65156f819507e423/pittseal360x360-edit.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-79.99588640000002000,"home_link":"","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7b/10384469bc3891766ffd0ab7eb40b4/wide-logo.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"During this course, students will gain an understanding of the Disaster Cycle, concentrating on the Mitigation Phase.
