{"about_the_course":"<span>Optimization technology is ubiquitous in our society. It schedules planes and their crews, coordinates the production of steel, and organizes the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Optimization clears the day-ahead and real-time markets to deliver electricity to millions of people. It organizes kidney exchanges and cancer treatments and helps scientists understand the fundamental fabric of life, control complex chemical reactions, and design drugs that may benefit billions of individuals.<br><br>This class is an introduction to discrete optimization and exposes students to some of the most fundamental concepts and algorithms in the field. It covers constraint programming, local search, and mixed-integer programming from their foundations to their applications for complex practical problems in areas such as scheduling, vehicle&nbsp;routing, supply-chain optimization, and resource allocation.<br><br>An introductory lecture to the course can viewed <a href=\"http://youtu.be/2IbJf4oXOxU\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</span>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/04/285ee1edee86aa30189148d2042051/DiscreetOptimisation_logo.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/45/44e0a84be0d543937212bed01ac226/DiscreetOptimisation_logo.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ca/4376935da5551984f133199185b62a/DiscreetOptimisation_logo.png","video":"kv_msJ-4Qsw","university-ids":["unimelb"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/kv_msJ-4Qsw/","id":174,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/72/4f6e42ac66db3c62341bc3b1397ca6/CourseEraSecondary.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"unimelb","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/fc137263568a25c66e2cc5f98ca899/UOM_16x16pxLogo.png","website_facebook":"melbuni","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/59304da07d93c8a2cbfc5ac4c6a269/Mel1.png","background_color":"","id":33,"location_city":"Melbourne","location_country":"AU","location_lat":-37.81410700000000000,"location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","primary_color":"#003366","abbr_name":"UniMelb","website":"http://www.unimelb.edu.au/","description":"The University of Melbourne is an internationally recognised research intensive University with a strong tradition of excellence in teaching, research, and community engagement.

Prior to that, he was professor of computer science at Brown University where he joined that faculty in 1990. His main research interests are\u00a0the design and implementation of optimization systems and their applications to complex problems. His current research projects focus on the use of optimization in disaster management, future energy systems, as well as in logistics and supply chains. He has written five books published by the MIT Press and built\u00a0several optimization systems that are widely used in academia and industry. He received an NSF Young investigator award in 1993, the 2002 INFORMS Computer Society Award, two Honorary Doctorate Degrees from the University of Louvain and the University of Nantes, the Philip J. Bray Award for Teaching Excellence in the Physical Sciences at Brown University, and became a fellow of AAAI in 2009. He has given plenary talks at the main conferences in artificial intelligence and operations research.\u00a0<br><br>Pascal has been teaching discrete optimization\u00a0at Brown University, the University of Louvain, and now the University of Melbourne\u00a0for almost 20 years.","university_logo":"","course-ids":[970239,971470],"display":true,"recommended_background":"Good programming skills, knowledge of fundamental algorithms, and linear algebra."}
