{"about_the_course":"<p>In this course\nI will cover main features and dilemmas of government\u2019s role and presence in\nthe private sector and the society. Unlike conventional public economic courses\nthat concentrate on taxation and public expenditures, I will offer a modern\nmultidisciplinary perspective of government as an economic agent.</p>\n\n<p>The course\nwill summarize a vast body of empirical evidence from around the world as to\nwhat factors make governments more or less efficient. </p>\n\n<p>Of primary\ninterest will be the agency relations between government and society, i.e. ways\nand means to ensure government accountability and prevention of the abuse of\npower. Accordingly we will discuss the impact of constitutions and political\nregimes on government performance. The course will also deal with how the size\nof government and state capacity affect development, and how those evolve over\ntime.</p>\n\n<p>We will\ndiscuss proper scope of government \u2013 what programs and services the state\nshould administer itself, and which of those should better be outsourced to\nprivate firms \u2013 perhaps in the private-public partnership format. </p>\n\n<p>An\nimportant theme of the course will be the choice of appropriate tools for\ngovernment intervention, and in particular - the tradeoff between public\nregulation, by\u00a0 resolving disputes by\ncourts, and by opting for self-regulation and other private sector mechanisms.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We will\ndiscuss government pathologies, most and foremost corruption and ways and means\nto keep it under control. The dual role of civil society as an alternative to government\nand factor of government accountability will be explored.\u00a0</p><span id=\"_wysihtml5-undo\" class=\"_wysihtml5-temp\"></span><p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/80/39a038465fe5a012e7a6f0a9dcbb50/Public-Economics.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a3/f485ade0f135e0e58b590e972af487/Public-Economics.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/62/37a5512bce2a6cd861113ad59b4799/Public-Economics.jpg","video":"wRIJ9atB1A0","university-ids":["hse"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/wRIJ9atB1A0/","id":1146,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"HSE_eng","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/2ccfbfa8ba1f56fd0265315a4e3ed0/f.png","website_facebook":"HSE.english","logo":"","background_color":"","id":160,"location_city":"Moscow","location_country":"RU","location_lat":55.75582600000000000,"location":"Russia, Moscow","primary_color":"#003399","abbr_name":"HSE","website":"http://www.hse.ru/","description":"National Research University - Higher School of Economics (HSE) is one of the top research universities in Russia.
