{"about_the_course":"The course provides an overview of C++ for the experienced C programmer. You will learn how C++ is more powerful than C. The C++ STL library will be featured. This library allows C++ programmers to code generically, efficiently and at a high level. You will learn how to write basic graph algorithms such as the shortest path algorithm. You'll then put this skill to use in a programming assignment aimed at producing an intelligent hex player.<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5a/9714c78f48e904da8812795fe243c9/Cplusplus_pic.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a8/5c08c3733378cb0084b2d43366edd3/Cplusplus_pic.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fa/d7bcd2453f7664b9dd47c6f4c78c91/Cplusplus_pic.jpg","video":"tph2O4qPNMg","university-ids":["ucsc"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/tph2O4qPNMg/","id":409,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"ucsc","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"ucsantacruz","logo":"","background_color":"","id":56,"location_city":"Santa Cruz","location_country":"US","location_lat":36.97411710000000000,"location":"Santa Cruz, CA","primary_color":"#296FA3","abbr_name":"UC Santa Cruz","website":"http://www.ucsc.edu/","description":"UC Santa Cruz is an outstanding public research university with a deep commitment to undergraduate education.
