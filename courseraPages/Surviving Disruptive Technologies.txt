{"about_the_course":"<p><b></b></p><p>The purpose of this course is to help individuals and organizations\nsurvive when confronted with disruptive technologies that threaten their\ncurrent way of life.&nbsp; We will look at a\ngeneral model of survival and use it to analyze companies and industries that\nhave failed or are close to failing.&nbsp; Examples\nof companies that have not survived include Kodak, a firm over 100 years old,\nBlockbuster and Borders.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is likely\nthat each of us has done business with all of these firms, and today Kodak and\nBlockbuster are in bankruptcy and Borders has been liquidated.&nbsp; Disruptions are impacting industries like\neducation; Coursera and others offering these massive open online courses are a\nchallenge for Universities.&nbsp; In addition\nto firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and are\ndoing well.&nbsp; What are their strategies\nfor survival?<br></p>\n\n<p>By highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and\nindustries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing\nfrom happening to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the\nstudy of successful organizations, we will try to tease out approaches to\ndisruptions that actually work.&nbsp; Our\nultimate objective is to develop a strategy for survival in a world confronting\none disruptive technology after another.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9d/c079805439e5decddf1f4f652c2994/lucas_logo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/e3da75bef8d155a36ddb3d468b5b9f/lucas_logo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cd/0c55405f6202a69f2d715e74c733b6/lucas_logo.jpg","video":"ZVw4ToQvgkE","university-ids":["umd"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/ZVw4ToQvgkE/","id":268,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/34/994080afbadb0c7bffae332a673aaf/University_of_Maryland_Logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UofMaryland","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/81bc9a607b97fadd8a2fdd6b66bfc2/favicon_16x16.ico","website_facebook":"UnivofMaryland","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/fd/01ba206b961003d2e4eb052d0ceac6/primarylogosm.png","background_color":"","id":32,"location_city":"21, Berwyn","location_country":"US","location_lat":38.98969670000000000,"location":"College Park, Maryland, USA","primary_color":"#990000","abbr_name":"UMD","website":"http://www.umd.edu/","description":"The University of Maryland is the state's flagship university and one of the nation's preeminent public research universities.
