It\nwill focus on the differences between countries that underlie observed levels\nof globalization and their implications for business. These differences will be summarized in terms\nof a framework for thinking about distances developed by Professor Ghemawat\nthat is widely used at leading business schools around the world.</p>\n\n<p>The final part of the course will synthesize the\nimplications of globalization for business strategies\u2014and for your personal\ndevelopment and career trajectories. &nbsp;</p><p>Praise</p><p><b>\"Pankaj Ghemawat is one of those rare individuals who combines world class scholarship with a deep knowledge of business practice.\"&nbsp;</b><br></p><p><i>Michael E.
