{"about_the_course":"The goal of this course is to introduce you to the basics of how computation\nhas impacted the entire workflow of photography (i.e., from how images\nare captured, manipulated and collaborated on, and shared). &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>The course begins with a conceptualization of&nbsp;photography as drawing\nwith light and the capturing of light to form images/videos. &nbsp;You\nwill learn about and understand how the optics and the sensor within a\ncamera are generalized, as well as learn about and understand how the lighting\nand other aspects of the environment are also generalized through computation\nto capture novel images.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>Pre- and post-processing techniques used to manipulate and improve images\nwill be discussed. &nbsp;Activities in this course are selected to give\nyou first hand experience with the power of the web and the Internet for\nboth analyzing and sharing images. &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>This course is interdisciplinary and draws upon concepts and principles\nfrom computer vision, computer graphics, image processing, mathematics\nand optics.\n<br>\n<br>We look forward to your engagement and participation with both the course\nand its discussion forums.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>About the TA</b>\n\n<br>Denis Lantsman is the TA for the class. Denis is a graduate of Harvey\nMudd College, and is currently finishing his MS in Machine Learning at\nGeorgia Tech. He is responsible for managing the coursera site, monitoring\nthe forums for student feedback, creating the homework assignments and\nquizzes, as well as recording weekly tutorials to help students with their\nprogramming.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compphoto/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compphoto/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compphoto/large-icon.png","video":"zFU30zBxbmc","university-ids":["gatech"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/zFU30zBxbmc/","id":87,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/f7803ce100fc4fd2ff4314a25995b3/Coursera-STO-logo-01.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"georgiatech","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/88/4d9c7e8a6ad0e787553d8b9d77d450/favicon-gatech.ico","website_facebook":"georgiatech","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/30/4b35cef753fcd6f13494279b65dc84/Georgia-Tech.png","background_color":"","id":9,"location_city":"Atlanta","location_country":"US","location_lat":33.77846260000000000,"location":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA","primary_color":"#C59353","abbr_name":"Georgia Tech","website":"http://www.gatech.edu/","description":"The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the nation's top research universities, distinguished by its commitment to improving the human condition through advanced science and technology.\n\nGeorgia Tech's campus occupies 400 acres in the heart of the city of Atlanta, where more than 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students receive a focused, technologically based education.","short_name":"gatech","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/24/0de4d4975ff698bdce7b8cf2f86c88/GT-Coursera-Banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"georgiatech","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ee/a21fe3506486f9ef6b5d7ca324d55f/banner-gatech.jpg","location_state":"GA","name":"Georgia Institute of Technology","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/27/a693dcb342a1ed209fdb0c2de7e6a3/GT-Coursera-logo-square.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/be/3e07cb47dd285544de28654fb24b18/GT-Coursera-logo-square.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/29/c5d764e8d4ad4eca175ca2f7a6ae40/GT-Coursera-logo-square.svg","location_lng":-84.39888059999998000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/4371496c5361191aa6a9721cfbe1cf/Georgia-Institute-of-Technology.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"In this course you will learn about the basics of how computation has impacted the entire workflow of photography (i.e., from how images are captured, manipulated and collaborated on, and shared).","description":"","short_name":"compphoto","target_audience":0,"faq":"<ul>\n    <li><strong>Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?</strong>\n\n    </li>Statement of accomplishment will be provided by <a href=\"http://c21u.gatech.edu/\"> Georgia Tech C21U </a>.</ul>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>What resources will I need for this class?</strong>\n\n    </li>You will need access to a camera and access to a computer with internet,\n    and time.\n    <br>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>How much math do I need to know?</b>\n\n    </li>College-level Mathematics (e.g., Linear Algebra, Calculus) is useful for\n    this course. &nbsp;You should know what are Matrices, Vectors, Differentiation,\n    and Integration. &nbsp;A working knowledge of Basic Probability (e.g.,\n    Probability Density Function) is needed. &nbsp;\n    <br>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>How much programming do I need to know?</b>\n\n    </li>We will use <a href=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python </a> with <a href=\"http://opencv.org/\"> OpenCV</a>&nbsp;to\n    do the programming assignments.
