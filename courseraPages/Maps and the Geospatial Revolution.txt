{"about_the_course":"The past decade has seen an explosion of new mechanisms for understanding and using location information in widely-accessible technologies. This Geospatial Revolution has resulted in the development of consumer GPS tools, interactive web maps, and location-aware mobile devices. These radical advances are making it possible for people from all walks of life to use, collect, and understand spatial information like never before.<br>&nbsp;<br>This course brings together core concepts in cartography, geographic information systems, and spatial thinking with real-world examples to provide the fundamentals necessary to engage with Geography beyond the surface-level. We will explore what makes spatial information special, how spatial data is created, how spatial analysis is conducted, and how to design maps so that they\u2019re effective at telling the stories we wish to share. To gain experience using this knowledge, we will work with the latest mapping and analysis software to explore geographic problems.&nbsp;","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/67/675cb1af3e868d0b5463bdf5c694e4/MapsGR_Logo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/8e/07b7e6bc9d0b1e178eebcf939c1172/MapsGR_Logo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5d/d09bd4de6f923c96083e1fe8d91075/MapsGR_Logo.jpg","video":"9lCwGxEt28w","university-ids":["psu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/9lCwGxEt28w/","id":418,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e4/7ae3ae59aca95f9fa9dc4c88414f3f/PSU-Shield-Wide.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"penn_state","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/be/4a6da97cb18e3f0543e11305aeec3b/psu_favicon.png","website_facebook":"pennstate","logo":"","background_color":"","id":51,"location_city":"College","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.79611110000000000,"location":"University Park, State College, PA, United States","primary_color":"","abbr_name":"Penn State","website":"http://psu.edu/","description":"Founded in 1855 as Pennsylvania's only land-grant university, The Pennsylvania State University combines academic rigor with a vibrant campus life.
