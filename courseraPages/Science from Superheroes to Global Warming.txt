{"about_the_course":"Have you ever wondered if Superman could really fly? What was \nSpiderman's spidey sense? How did Wonder Woman's invisible jet work? \nWhat does it really mean for something to be a scientific \"fact\"? \nExplore how science works and what constitutes \"good\" science through \ncase studies drawn from a wide spectrum of people's experience, for \nexample superheros, movies, and real world issues such as global \nwarming. The case studies will provide the chance to act as science \ncritics as the students develop a better appreciation for science and \nthe scientific method.<br><br>This course won the 2011 \"Best OCW User Experience\" Award from Education Portal and was featured in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/education/edlife/18superhero-t.html\">New York Times</a>. <br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c8/0738a4096cdff7b7b9ab0285618692/460px_x_259px_female_superhero_used_for_Physics_Coursera.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/59/17e42d97116e10fe25dc71b0b2787f/460px_x_259px_female_superhero_used_for_Physics_Coursera.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/56/fbfabd3679d122b17ad4696ece54c8/460px_x_259px_female_superhero_used_for_Physics_Coursera.jpg","video":"sITa8jb2ji0","university-ids":["uci"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/sITa8jb2ji0/","id":205,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/33/e75ec0e47204f7a8f928ca487d52ee/logo_uci_rectangle_vector.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UCIrvine","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/fe2ddd0d8a37bbb16033878eac3d75/16x16_uci.png","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/30/f54378236f5403bb12ad3d06123fa9/logo_uci_rectangle_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":30,"location_city":"Irvine","location_country":"US","location_lat":33.68394730000000000,"location":"Irvine, CA, USA","primary_color":"#008C44","abbr_name":"UC Irvine","website":"http://uci.edu/","description":"Since 1965, the University of California, Irvine has combined the strengths of a major research university with the bounty of an incomparable Southern California location.

He is a Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Dennin's research focuses on the behavior of foam (such as shaving cream) &nbsp;and other complex fluids&nbsp;and questions of mechanics in biology (such as how particles enter the bloodstream through the lungs). He is also very interested in increasing the public awareness of science, and as part of this effort, he&nbsp;appears on a number of programs on the History Channel.<br><br>CONTACT INFORMATION:<br>scientificthinking.coursera@unx.uci.edu<br>Due to the large number of enrolled students and the open online nature of this course, I will likely not be able to respond to individual student emails.
