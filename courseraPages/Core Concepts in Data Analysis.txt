{"about_the_course":"<p>This is an\nunconventional course in modern Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Data\nMining. Its contents are heavily influenced by the idea that data analysis\nshould help in enhancing and augmenting knowledge of the domain as represented\nby the concepts and statements of relation between them. According to this\nview, two main pathways for data analysis are summarization, for developing and\naugmenting concepts, and correlation, for enhancing and establishing relations.\nThe term summarization embraces here both simple summaries like totals and\nmeans and more complex summaries: the principal\ncomponents of a set of features and cluster structures in a set of entities.\nSimilarly, correlation covers both bivariate and multivariate relations between\ninput and target features including Bayes classifiers.</p>\n\n<span>The view of the data as a subject of\ncomputational data analysis that is adhered to here has emerged quite recently.\nTypically, in sciences and in statistics, a problem comes first, and then the\ninvestigator turns to data that might be useful in advancing towards a\nsolution. Yet nowadays the situation is reversed frequently, especially with\nthe advent of Big Data. Typical questions then are: Take a look at this data\nset - what sense can be made out of it? \u2013 Is there any structure in the data\nset? Can these features help in predicting those? This is more reminiscent to a\ntraveler\u2019s view of the world rather than that of a scientist. The scientist\nsits at his desk, gets reproducible signals from the universe and tries to accommodate\nthem into a great model of the universe. The traveler deals with what come on\ntheir way \u2013 here is the data analysis niche.\u00a0\nA textbook by the instructor along these lines has been published by\nSpringer-London in 2011: \u201cCore\nconcepts in data analysis is clean and devoid\nof any fuzziness. The author presents his theses with a refreshing clarity\nseldom seen in a text of this sophistication. \u2026 To single out just one of the\ntext\u2019s many successes: I doubt readers will ever encounter again such a detailed\nand excellent treatment of correlation concepts.
