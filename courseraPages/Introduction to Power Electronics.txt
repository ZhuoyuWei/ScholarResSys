{"about_the_course":"The course is an introduction to switched-mode power converters. It provides a basic knowledge of circuitry for the control and conversion of electrical power with high efficiency. These converters can change and regulate the voltage, current, or power; dc-dc converters, ac-dc rectifiers, dc-ac inverters, and ac-ac cycloconverters are in common use. Applications include electronic power supplies, aerospace and vehicular power systems, and renewable energy systems.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/58/79756faa2f1227bb1c6e60522f446a/image.jpeg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1b/40b383b0d0d0dfbe9eed8008649a61/image.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1c/110aebe42e22a214b71f2b2a3a2529/image.jpg","video":"XKpBkVmYlNk","university-ids":["boulder","cusystem"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/XKpBkVmYlNk/","id":475,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"cuboulder","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"cuboulder","logo":"","background_color":"","id":71,"location_city":"Boulder","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.01498560000000000,"location":"","primary_color":"#605221","abbr_name":"CU-Boulder","website":"http://www.colorado.edu/","description":"CU-Boulder is a dynamic community of scholars and learners on one of the most spectacular college campuses in the country.
