{"about_the_course":"<p>Many of us derive inspiration from watching natural history\ndocumentaries and their astounding catalogue of wild animal\u00a0behaviours.\u00a0 In this course, we will explore how\nscientists study animal behaviour, and in particular how behaviour is shaped by\u00a0the evolutionary forces of natural and sexual\nselection.\u00a0Topics include\u00a0resource acquisition; avoiding enemies; mate choice and sexual conflict; cues, signals and communication; parental care and social behaviour; and\nthe role of genes, environments and learning in regulating behavioural diversity.\u00a0\u00a0We\ndraw on examples from across the animal kingdom to illustrate\u00a0the complex\nmechanisms underlying adaptations,\u00a0and complement these with natural\nhistory videos that highlight key concepts. We evaluate the scientific rigour\nof studies used to test theory, and highlight the often ingenious methods\nadopted by researchers to understand animal behaviour.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/83/ab9beea7399de3ae0106aee093fe02/peacock-spider-2.jpeg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/01/7e6485c20a9eac0e9a92c5432e8404/peacock-spider-2.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/da/9a23ca374a5d18631c8f4d6b0c49d4/peacock-spider-2.jpg","video":"i0v75KNcs1I","university-ids":["unimelb"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/i0v75KNcs1I/","id":172,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/72/4f6e42ac66db3c62341bc3b1397ca6/CourseEraSecondary.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"unimelb","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/fc137263568a25c66e2cc5f98ca899/UOM_16x16pxLogo.png","website_facebook":"melbuni","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/59304da07d93c8a2cbfc5ac4c6a269/Mel1.png","background_color":"","id":33,"location_city":"Melbourne","location_country":"AU","location_lat":-37.81410700000000000,"location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","primary_color":"#003366","abbr_name":"UniMelb","website":"http://www.unimelb.edu.au/","description":"The University of Melbourne is an internationally recognised research intensive University with a strong tradition of excellence in teaching, research, and community engagement.
