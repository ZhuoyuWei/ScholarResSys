{"about_the_course":"Computer networks from ISPs to WiFi and cellular networks are a key part\nof the information economy. These networks are the foundation for the Web,\nand they enable companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. This course\nintroduces the fundamental problems of computer networking, from sending\nbits over wires to running distributed applications. For each problem,\nwe explore the design strategies that have proven valuable in practice.\nTopics include error detection and correction, multiple-access, bandwidth\nallocation, routing, internetworking, reliability, quality of service,\nnaming, content delivery, and security. As we cover these topics, you will\nlearn how the internals of the Internet work to support the Web and other\nnetworked applications. You will develop a detailed understanding of widely-used\nnetworking technologies such as TCP/IP, HTTP, 802.11, Ethernet, and DNS.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/comnetworks/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/comnetworks/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/comnetworks/large-icon.png","video":"","university-ids":["uw"],"video_baseurl":"","id":105,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UW","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/7480c1f9271144aa75fe024a1ad5a0/favicon-uw.ico","website_facebook":"UofWA","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/53/2f0ff155b3390e3d7190c363a4a045/uw-logo-coursera-transparent.png","location_lat":47.60620950000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Seattle","location_country":"US","id":15,"location":"Seattle, WA","primary_color":"#38255A","abbr_name":"Washington","website":"https://www.washington.edu/","description":"Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world.","short_name":"uw","location_state":"WA","website_youtube":"user/uwhuskies","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5d/7f56a74b7b3009b4a888e372a41f67/banner-uw1.jpg","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d0/f1be9c6b196a5a0446da96548a85b6/banner-uw1.jpg","name":"University of Washington","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8a/903cf68039c31a207eb7eafff458f7/w-patch-purple.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/76/45ce3d3eba0b28c763eacbb2387322/w-patch-purple.png","display":true,"location_lng":-122.33207080000000000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","square_logo_svg":""}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"The Internet is a computer network that millions of people use every day.
