{"about_the_course":"The discovery of extra-solar planets orbiting other stars has been one of the major breakthroughs in astronomy of the past decades, changing our view on the formation of planetary systems, mainly drawn from the observation of the Solar System.\u00a0Today, over 860 exoplanets are known and the Kepler satellite has recently identified over 2700 additional candidates, most of them awaiting for confirmation. We have learned that exoplanets are extremely common objects in the Universe and\u00a0that planetary systems are much more diverse than originally predicted. <br><br>Our knowledge about exoplanets has dramatically increased thanks to the systematic monitoring of stars in the solar\u00a0neighborhood by radial velocities, photometry, microlensing,\u00a0and recently direct imaging, bringing valuable constraints to planet formation theories,\u00a0as well as to models of planet interior structure, and atmosphere physics. In this course, we will review the main discoveries, describing the different approaches to detect exoplanets and\u00a0characterise\u00a0their orbital and physical properties.<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b6/f82873962dc3057bc7a6e3ae499bbe/exoplanet07.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/21/e3615ff6475b89079e4d83d026a1eb/exoplanet07.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/eb/8419ebf39f0f674254f4d23a54d5f2/exoplanet07.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["unige"],"video_baseurl":"","id":484,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UNIGEnews","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2d/ced013338cdff809fbdde5a24f3354/UNIGE-SmallIcon-16x16.png","website_facebook":"unigeneve","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/a4770a9c65f63ea149919431ad519e/UNIGE-Logo-MainPage.png","background_color":"","id":49,"location_city":"Gen\u00e8ve","location_country":"CH","location_lat":46.19839220000000000,"location":"Geneva, Suisse","primary_color":"#CF0063","abbr_name":"UNIGE","website":"http://www.unige.ch/","description":"Founded in 1559, the University of Geneva (UNIGE) is one of Europe's leading universities.
