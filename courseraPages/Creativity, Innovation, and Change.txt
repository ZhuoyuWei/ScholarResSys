In this course,\n    you will have the opportunity to learn how you can be a strong positive\n    force in your society and how to pass on your knowledge and experience\n    to others so that everyone will prosper.\n    <br>\n    <br><b>Are there different tracks I can take based upon my level of commitment?<br></b>\n\n    <p>From previous MOOC offerings, we know that not all students engage with\n        the course materials and assignments in the same way or with the same intensity.\n        This is fully understandable! You might have lots of time and interest,\n        and so are ready to invest deeply in this course; or you might have many\n        life commitments that leave you with less time, but still want to learn\n        many of the concepts that this course will offer. We want to make our class\n        useful for YOU -- whatever your life and interests lead you to right now\n        -- and so we are creating three kinds of student profiles, called Adventurers,\n        Explorers, and Tourists.</p>\n    <p><i>Adventurers</i>. You have signed up for the class and are serious about\n        mastering the entire course. You are committed to doing the course-related\n        quizzes, activities, and assignments, AND you are eager and able to complete\n        a course-long project, either alone or as part of a team. As an Adventurer,\n        you want to take full advantage of this great opportunity to build on your\n        creative potential and create something innovative that will change your\n        life or the lives of those around you for the better!</p>\n    <p><i>Explorers</i>. You are eager to learn and contribute to the course,\n        but your available time allows you to participate only in the class assignments\n        (weekly quizzes and activities), not in project work. You are excited about\n        the material and play an active role in the course, perhaps by providing\n        feedback and mentoring other students, just as Adventurers and Tourists\n        can do at any time. We need the contributions of everyone in the community!</p><span><i>Tourists</i>. You have signed up for the class, love it, want to take it, but because of other commitments in life, you cannot commit to the course all the time. This is fine! As a Tourist, you come and go to the course platform, watch some of the videos now and then, participate in some activities here and there, and do your best to stick with the class from the beginning to the end , trying to get as much as you can out of it. Maybe ...you will have more time to commit to the class in future offerings!</span>\n\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div><b>Has this course been taught before?</b>\n\n</div>\n<div>Yes, in a classroom setting. In converting this material into a MOOC format,\n    we are conducting a grand experiment - and one in which we invite you to\n    participate fully\u00a0\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div><b>Will there be exams? What will I have to turn in?\u00a0</b>\n\n</div>\n<div>Some of the modules will contain quizzes to assess skill development and\n    mastery. Other modules will require other kinds of output (e.g., idea journals,\n    prototypes) to demonstrate progress.\u00a0\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div><b>How will the course be graded?</b>\n\n</div>\n<div>Course participants will submit ideas, products, and exercises for peer\n    review. The peer review process is an essential component of the class,\n    as it exposes students to creative diversity from the feedback they receive\n    and inspiration from other projects they review. All participants who complete\n    the specified number of assignments with quality deemed appropriate will\n    receive a statement of accomplishment\u00a0documenting successful course\n    completion.\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div><b>Will the course be challenging? Will it be fun?\u00a0</b>\n\n</div>\n<div>Yes. Contrary to popular belief, creativity is something that we can study\n    pretty rigorously, and that\u2019s a good thing. Besides, as other people have\n    probably been telling you all your life - you get out of learning what\n    you put into it. But there will also be ample opportunities to have fun\n    in this course, so you can expect to enjoy it as well!\u00a0\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <br>\n</div>\n<div><b>Will I be expected to produce something creative? What if I fail?\u00a0</b>\n\n</div>\n<div>Yes - and we will guide you there. The creative \u201csomething\u201d you produce\n    will align with your own unique brand of creativity, whether you are a\n    person who thinks creatively through careful attention to detail or a person\n    who prefers to break through barriers for innovative results. Either way,\n    failure is part of the process; your success will be a function of what\n    you learn from each failure.\u00a0\n    <br>\n</div>","category-ids":["infotech","business","education","ee","socsci"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"<p>Time-frame: 8 weeks, starting in September 2013 </p><p>Week 1: Creative Identity </p><ul><li><p>The Importance of Failure</p></li><li><p>Creative Diversity</p></li><li><p>Establishing and Building Character</p></li></ul><p>Week 2: Idea Generation</p><ul><li><p>Ideation Methods</p></li><li><p>Idea Journal</p></li><li><p>Creative Divergence</p></li></ul><p>Week 3: Idea Evaluation</p><ul><li><p>Idea Evaluation Methods</p></li><li><p>Critical Problem Solving Techniques</p></li><li><p>Establishing What to do and How to do it</p></li></ul><p>Week 4: Building a Creative Team</p><ul><li><p>Creative Diversity Application</p></li><li><p>Collaboration Skills</p></li><li><p>Team Formation in Organizations</p></li></ul><p>Week 5: Inspiration and Research</p><ul><li><p>Receiving advice and feedback</p></li><li><p>Finding out what others have done</p></li></ul><p>Week 6: Creativity Metrics</p><ul><li><p>8th Muda: Measuring Latent Creativity</p></li><li><p>Level and Style Metrics</p></li><li><p> Lag versus Lead Metrics</p></li></ul><p>Week 7: Experiment Planning and Prototyping</p><ul><li><p>Problem Solving Methods</p></li><li><p>Intelligent Fast Failure and Experimentation</p></li><li><p>Taking Full Ownership Creative Project</p></li></ul><p>Week 8: CIC Synthesis and Reflection</p><ul><li><p>Next Steps</p></li><li><p>CLICK: Creating Leadership through Ideas resulting in Change and Knowledge </p></li><li><p>Project Showcasing</p></li></ul><ul>\n</ul>","course_format":"<p>This course will employ both traditional and nontraditional methods of online teaching, with a focus on experiential learning.
