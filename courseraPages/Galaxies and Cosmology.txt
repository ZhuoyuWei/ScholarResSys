{"about_the_course":"This class is an introduction to the modern extragalactic astronomy and cosmology, i.e., the part of astrophysics that deals with the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole, and its major constituents: dark matter, dark energy, galaxies, quasars, large-scale structure, and intergalactic gas. \u00a0It will cover the subjects including: relativistic cosmological models and their parameters, extragalactic distance scale, cosmological tests, composition of the universe, dark matter, and dark energy; the hot big bang, cosmic nucleosynthesis, recombination, and cosmic microwave background; formation and evolution of structure in the universe; galaxy clusters, large-scale structure and its evolution; galaxies, their properties and fundamental correlations; formation and evolution of galaxies; star formation history of the universe; quasars and other active galactic nuclei, and their evolution; structure and evolution of the intergalactic medium; diffuse extragalactic backgrounds; the first stars, galaxies, and the reionization era. \u00a0It corresponds to the Ay 21 class taught at Caltech.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/cosmo/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/cosmo/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/cosmo/large-icon.png","video":"ddQrI3_ADfA","university-ids":["caltech"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/ddQrI3_ADfA/","id":81,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"caltech","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1c/237c842c020ea0a3a6c9647d5cbd66/favicon-caltech.ico","website_facebook":"californiainstituteoftechnology","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1f/ae499b8bc31f3f297a044e6e7dbf22/wordmarl_160x60_Trans.png","background_color":"","id":12,"location_city":"Pasadena","location_country":"US","location_lat":34.14778490000000000,"location":"Pasadena, CA, USA","primary_color":"#ED682B","abbr_name":"Caltech","website":"http://caltech.edu/","description":"The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is a world-renowned science and engineering research and education institution, where extraordinary faculty and students seek answers to complex questions, discover new knowledge, lead innovation, and transform our future.
