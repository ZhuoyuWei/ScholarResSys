{"about_the_course":"<p>The Dalai\nLama has said that Buddhism and science are deeply compatible and has\nencouraged Western scholars to critically examine both the meditative practice\nand Buddhist ideas about the human mind. A number of scientists and\nphilosophers have taken up this challenge. There have been brain scans of\nmeditators and philosophical examinations of Buddhist doctrines. There have\neven been discussions of Darwin and the Buddha: Do early Buddhist descriptions\nof the mind, and of the human condition, make particular sense in light of\nevolutionary psychology?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>This course\nwill examine how Buddhism is faring under this scrutiny. Are neuroscientists\nstarting to understand how meditation \u201cworks\u201d? Would such an understanding\nvalidate meditation\u2014or might physical explanations of meditation undermine the\nspiritual significance attributed to it? And how are some of the basic Buddhist\nclaims about the human mind holding up? We\u2019ll pay special attention to some\nhighly counterintuitive doctrines: that the self doesn\u2019t exist, and that much\nof perceived reality is in some sense illusory. Do these claims, radical as\nthey sound, make a certain kind of sense in light of modern psychology? And\nwhat are the implications of all this for how we should live our lives? Can\nmeditation make us not just happier, but better people?</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/8dcec40564356891cee5558ebf58f3/psychbuddhism-logo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3f/e4c7846bdb4ea1af06d1e1665d703d/psychbuddhism-logo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/7bbb0503f7d2f87225689b3928378c/psychbuddhism-logo.jpg","video":"_bdRjzlWgfg","university-ids":["princeton"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/_bdRjzlWgfg/","id":1121,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"princeton","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/29daf4b768e1aa467202d4d2dcf8d8/favicon-princeton.ico","website_facebook":"PrincetonU","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/94/cc9200e336d38ce029873b13cbe93b/logo-princeton-front.png","background_color":"","id":4,"location_city":"Princeton","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.35729760000000000,"location":"Princeton, NJ","primary_color":"#BA632D","abbr_name":"Princeton","website":"http://www.princeton.edu/","description":"Princeton University is a private research university located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.
