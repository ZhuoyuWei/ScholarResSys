{"about_the_course":"<p>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n</p><p>We make economics\ndecisions every day: what to buy, whether to work or play, what to\nstudy. We respond to markets all the time: prices influence our\ndecisions, markets signal where to put effort, they direct firms to\nproduce certain goods over others. Economics is all around us.&nbsp;</p><p>This\ncourse is a rigorous introduction to the microeconomic theory of\nmarkets: why we have them, how they work, what they accomplish. We\nwill explore what outcomes they generate when they work well\nand what happens when they do not. We will learn why governments are\nimportant and when regulation and intervention is necessary. Examples\nare taken from everyday life, from goods and services that we all\npurchase and use. We will apply the theory to current events and\npolicy debates through weekly exercises. These will empower you to be\nan educated, critical thinker who can understand, analyze and\nevaluate market outcomes. \n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p><p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/d29c75169172a7c1b1cdb15bb47b4c/DS_tax.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/25/a4d4bafdf99a50b9b0912510f47d42/DS_tax.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/9b9866d34641e63662e14bb00abdc8/DS_tax.png","video":"pz3SyOk6ZgM","university-ids":["penn"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/pz3SyOk6ZgM/","id":277,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/14/c965e1f5cf9ead221ad770bd907f3a/Penn-logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"pennopencourses","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png","location_lat":39.95233500000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Philadelphia","location_country":"US","id":6,"location":"Philadelphia, PA","primary_color":"#0000FF","abbr_name":"Penn","website":"http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning","description":"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.
