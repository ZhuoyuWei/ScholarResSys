Having said that, exposure to economics (the mother discipline of finance), accounting (the language of business), and/or algebra and statistics (we all need it) will clearly help. \u00a0I will however try and cover everything starting with fundamentals and will highlight when there is a need for you to do some further work in specific subjects. \u00a0In fact, I hope the class will motivate you to learn more. \u00a0I believe that learning usually happens when you are motivated by a curiosity to understand something."}
