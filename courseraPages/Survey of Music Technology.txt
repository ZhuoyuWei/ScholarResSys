{"about_the_course":"<p>\n    <br>How can we use computers to create expressive, compelling music? And how\n    can we write computer software to help us create and organize sounds in\n    new ways? This course provides a hands-on introduction to the field of\n    music technology as both a creative musical practice and an interdisciplinary\n    technical research pursuit. Through the exploration of topics such as acoustics,\n    psychoacoustics, digital sound, digital signal processing, audio synthesis,\n    spectral analysis, algorithmic composition, and music information retrieval,\n    we will explore the deep relationships between art and science, between\n    theory and practice, and between experimental and popular electronic music.</p>We will learn about these topics in the context of digital audio\nworkstation (DAW) software, the multi-track editing paradigm that has been\ndominant in music production since the 1980s. As we learn about the foundations\nbehind such software, we will use this knowledge to more effectively create\nmusic with it, and we will also write a series of short software programs\nthat extend the software\u2019s ability to manipulate, transform, and analyze\nsound.<br><br><b>Grading Policy:</b><br><p>There will be a quiz at the end of each module (except module 0) for a total of 6 quizzes. Quizzes consist of multiple-choice and short-response questions and cover lecture material from the module.</p><p>There are two hands-on projects in the course, due at the end of module 3 and at the end of module 5. These projects will be graded through a peer assessment system.</p><p>The grade breakdown is as follows:</p><ul><li>60% - quizzes</li><li>40% - projects</li></ul><p>In order to receive a statement of accomplishment, you must get 70% or higher for the course. In order to receive a statement of accomplishment with distinction, you must get 90% or higher for the course.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ab/adf89f2824a6053fe8550b72cc0c2bda/freeman-icon.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/a0686f1601a2634d230c4b47ffb5f9/freeman-icon.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e5/0d77b616fc55b86c82e6508cf6efa0/freeman-icon.jpg","video":"SjRoWD735Mg","university-ids":["gatech"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/SjRoWD735Mg/","id":311,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/f7803ce100fc4fd2ff4314a25995b3/Coursera-STO-logo-01.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"georgiatech","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/88/4d9c7e8a6ad0e787553d8b9d77d450/favicon-gatech.ico","website_facebook":"georgiatech","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/30/4b35cef753fcd6f13494279b65dc84/Georgia-Tech.png","location_lat":33.77846260000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Atlanta","location_country":"US","id":9,"location":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA","primary_color":"#C59353","abbr_name":"Georgia Tech","website":"http://www.gatech.edu/","description":"The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the nation's top research universities, distinguished by its commitment to improving the human condition through advanced science and technology.\n\nGeorgia Tech's campus occupies 400 acres in the heart of the city of Atlanta, where more than 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students receive a focused, technologically based education.","short_name":"gatech","location_state":"GA","website_youtube":"georgiatech","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ee/a21fe3506486f9ef6b5d7ca324d55f/banner-gatech.jpg","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/24/0de4d4975ff698bdce7b8cf2f86c88/GT-Coursera-Banner.jpg","name":"Georgia Institute of Technology","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/27/a693dcb342a1ed209fdb0c2de7e6a3/GT-Coursera-logo-square.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/be/3e07cb47dd285544de28654fb24b18/GT-Coursera-logo-square.png","display":true,"location_lng":-84.39888059999998000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/4371496c5361191aa6a9721cfbe1cf/Georgia-Institute-of-Technology.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/29/c5d764e8d4ad4eca175ca2f7a6ae40/GT-Coursera-logo-square.svg"}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Learn to make music with digital audio workstation software, understand the theory and history behind music production tools, and write your own computer programs to make new music and sounds.","description":"","short_name":"musictech","target_audience":0,"faq":"<strong>Will I get a certificate after completing this class?</strong><span>\n <span><span>\n  <span>\n  <p><b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</b>Certificate of Completion will be provided by Georgia\nTech C21U&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></b></p><p><b>What resources will I need for this class?</b></p>\n  <p>You need a Mac or Windows computer and a reasonably\n  good pair of headphones or speakers.
