{"about_the_course":"\"Introduction to Databases\" had a very successful public offering in fall\n2011, as one of Stanford's inaugural three massive open online courses.\nSince then, the course materials have been improved and expanded, and all\nmaterials are available for self-study. Students have access to lectures\nwith in-video quizzes, multiple-choice quiz assignments, automatically-checked\ninteractive programming exercises, midterm and final exams, a discussion\nforum, optional additional exercises with solutions, and pointers to readings\nand resources. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the curriculum draws\nfrom Stanford's popular Introduction to Databases course. The material\npresented here is the same as the corresponding material presented on Stanford's\nClass2Go platform.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<h2>Why Learn About Databases?</h2>\nDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by\nmost people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge\nfraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications\nsystems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software\nsystem or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information.\nIn addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other\nproperties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability,\nefficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level\nquery languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer\nscience graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most\nuseful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b5/62b8827c61b48597f9b526ce04aaee/dbLogo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cb/61b70b13451469aa582fc91d020f64/dbLogo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c9/643d403b593b865b40c64b0f6cc33c/dbLogo.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["stanford"],"video_baseurl":"","id":12,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png","background_color":"","id":1,"location_city":"Palo Alto","location_country":"US","location_lat":37.44188340000000000,"location":"Palo Alto, CA, United States","primary_color":"#8C1515","abbr_name":"Stanford","website":"","description":"The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.","short_name":"stanford","landing_page_banner":"","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"","partner_type":1,"banner":"","location_state":"CA","name":"Stanford University","square_logo":"","square_logo_source":"","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-122.14301949999998000,"home_link":"http://online.stanford.edu/","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":32,"short_description":"This course covers database design and the use of database management systems for applications.","description":"","short_name":"db","target_audience":0,"faq":"","category-ids":["cs-systems","cs-programming"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"This course covers database design and the use of database management\nsystems for applications.
