{"about_the_course":"<p><span>This <b>first module in the two module course sequence</b> critically examines\nthe consequences of current water and sanitation conditions, including over 2\nmillion deaths annually due to water-related diseases, millions of dollars in\navoidable health care expenditures, and billions of hours spent carrying water\nfrom sources outside the home. Reducing such costs associated with poor water\nand sanitation services is one of the major challenges for States in the Global\nSouth in the 21st century. The technologies to provide networked water\nand sanitation services are well-known, as are many low-cost, non-network\nsolutions that would appear affordable to many poor households in developing\ncountries. For decades the international community and national governments\nhave struggled to find institutional and financial arrangements to provide\nthese technologies to households and businesses in developing countries, with\nmixed success. Although progress is being made in many parts of the world,\nmillions of households in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia still face a\nlifetime without the improved water and sanitation services that citizens in\nindustrialized countries take for granted. </span></p>\n\n<p>The <b>second module</b> will focus on what can be done to solve global water\nand sanitation problems. We will examine the main strategies that donors and\nnational governments have tried to change status quo water and sanitation\nconditions, and the lessons learned from these experiences. </p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d0/60f1589ff4a874e524529a38efeade/GWP-for-MOOC_1_cropped.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/b7999665302aaa7ad9ef5b5f5c80d4/GWP-for-MOOC_1_cropped.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c0/f22c9030825eac8cf4c8a8536c6655/GWP-for-MOOC_1_cropped.jpg","video":"Xf4cVbmgdT8","university-ids":["manchester"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/Xf4cVbmgdT8/","id":898,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"AdmissionsUoM","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/9d/5244ef42338d893472c33dac75833c/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"AdmissionsUoM","logo":"","location_lat":53.47932400000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Manchester","location_country":"GB","id":147,"location":"Manchester, United Kingdom","primary_color":"#660099","abbr_name":"Manchester","website":"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/","description":"Tracing its roots back to 1824, the University of Manchester is home to almost 40,000 students.
