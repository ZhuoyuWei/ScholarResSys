{"about_the_course":"The course objective is to enable each student to enhance his or her quantitative\nscientific reasoning about problems related to human health. Biostatistics\nis about quantitative approaches - ideas and skills - to address bioscience\nand health problems. To achieve mastery of biostatistics skills, a student\nmust \u201csee one, do one, teach one.\u201d Therefore, the course is organized to\npromote regular practice of new ideas and methods.\n<br>\n<br>The course is organized into 3 self-contained modules. Each module\nexcept the first is built around an important health problem.&nbsp;The\nfirst module reviews the scientific method and the role of experimentation\nand observation to generate data, or evidence, relevant to selecting among\ncompeting hypotheses about the natural world. Bayes theorem is used to\nquantify the concept of evidence. Then, we will discuss what is meant by\nthe notion of \u201ccause.\u201d\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>In the second module, we use a national survey dataset to estimate the\ncosts of smoking and smoking-caused disease in American society. The concepts\nof point and interval estimation are introduced. Students will master the\nuse of confidence intervals to draw inferences about population means and\ndifferences of means. They will use stratification and weighted averages\nto compare subgroups that are otherwise similar in an attempt to estimate\nthe effects of smoking and smoking-caused diseases on medical expenditures.\n<br><span><br>In the final module, we will study what factors influence child-survival in Nepal using data from the Nepal Nutritional Intervention Study Sarlahi or NNIPPS. Students will estimate and obtain confidence intervals for infant survival rates, relative rates and odds ratios within strata defined by gestational period, singleton vs twin births, and parental characteristics. </span>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/eb/6b7395be55d44abbba136ddacb3161/case_based-01.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/58/e41b25ddf38dd0e2fbd97cdf1375a6/case_based-01.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/96/33ebecbf94923237fd44c83f66682d/case_based-01.jpg","video":"RYonKsHzlpU","university-ids":["jhu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/RYonKsHzlpU/","id":429,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/0fb2d85007ca7f6d671b73e64a44d6/nursing.logo.large.horizontal.blue.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"JohnsHopkins","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico","website_facebook":"johnshopkinsuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png","background_color":"","id":8,"location_city":"Baltimore","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.29038480000000000,"location":"Baltimore, MD","primary_color":"#0061AA","abbr_name":"Johns Hopkins","website":"http://www.jhu.edu/","description":"The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.","short_name":"jhu","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"johnshopkins","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg","location_state":"MD","name":"Johns Hopkins University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/229e9cabab40da92cdd0fc46cd7e06/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/4b4ca39464d8fd3a75bf8a68d0a1d9/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-76.61218930000001000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Learn to frame and address health-related questions using modern biostatistics ideas and methods.","description":"","short_name":"casebasedbiostat","target_audience":0,"faq":"<ul>\n    <li>Will I earn a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this course?</li>\n</ul>Students who achieve a sufficient grade will receive a statement of accomplishment\nsigned by the course instructor.\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n    <li>Will I be able to participate if I don't speak English?</li>\n</ul>All lectures and course communications&nbsp;will be delivered in English.\nYou are welcome to communicate with classmates in the language of your\nchoice, but all course assignments must be submitted in English.\n<br>","category-ids":["health","stats"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"","course_format":"For each module, students will complete a set of practice problems and then one or two graded quizzes to demonstrate their mastery of the ideas and methods taught in the\nmodule.
