{"about_the_course":"<p></p>\n\n<p>Global health is public health at the global level. It deals\nwith the interconnections between peoples from all over the world. It is based\non the idea that it is necessary to cooperate internationally to respond to diseases,\ndisasters and conflicts which now threaten us all. Humanitarianism, in all its\nvarious forms, is one such response. \u00a0In\nattempting to organise a humanitarian intervention, though, we are confronted\nby a wide range of problems. Most acute of these is the intense inequality which\nmarks the contemporary world. Public health \u2013 its capacities, delivery structures\nand finances \u2013 is profoundly different for the 1 billion people who live in the\nworld\u2019s wealthier countries. Those elsewhere have much more limited access to publicly\nfunded or privately insured medicine. As a consequence, non-governmental humanitarian\norganisations now deliver a large proportion of the world\u2019s health care.</p>\n\n<p>This course introduces these issues by looking first at the\nvague, yet highly contested, notion a global health agenda. It then goes on to\nconsider how and why the world\u2019s wealthier countries have sought to develop a\nresponse to the emergencies and crises that the vulnerabilities of others have\nproduced. Here, public pressure and the ethical imperative to bear witness when\nconfronted with such suffering are especially important. Finally, the course\nconsiders whether or not humanitarian assistance can be considered a right. It\nlooks at the emerging Responsibility to Protect agenda and the associated moral\ndilemmas around sovereignty, post-colonialism and duty-based ethics.</p>\n\n<p>Within this context, the course explores these critical normatiive and logistical questions:</p><p></p><ul><li>Is humanitarian aid as a concept, as simple as the rich helping the poor?<br></li><li>Are these interventions well-meaning and effective?\u00a0<br></li><li>Should governments be committing tax revenues \u2013 involuntarily given \u2013 to improve the health of others far away?<br></li><li>Do those that can afford it have a responsibility to act in some way?<br></li><li>What does receipt of aid mean for the recipient country, its leadership, its future, and its responsibility?<br></li><li>Must people be helped only according to need, regardless of what a regime might have done?<br></li><li>Must humanitarians remain neutral \u2013 silent perhaps \u2013 in the face of injustice in order to ensure access?<br></li><li>Must the causes of inequality, suffering and violence be ignored in favour of access, action and outcome?</li></ul><p></p><p></p>\n\n<p>What do you think...?</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c3/bc801a79d32db4b4179942b7e15dc8/GlobalHealth600x340.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3e/bb2205b449b95312df4533edff20b4/GlobalHealth600x340.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/74/f6766fa319fad2be8e8be48213b60e/GlobalHealth600x340.jpg","video":"TeAT1cYNg-k","university-ids":["manchester"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/TeAT1cYNg-k/","id":901,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"AdmissionsUoM","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/9d/5244ef42338d893472c33dac75833c/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"AdmissionsUoM","logo":"","background_color":"","id":147,"location_city":"Manchester","location_country":"GB","location_lat":53.47932400000000000,"location":"Manchester, United Kingdom","primary_color":"#660099","abbr_name":"Manchester","website":"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/","description":"Tracing its roots back to 1824, the University of Manchester is home to almost 40,000 students.
