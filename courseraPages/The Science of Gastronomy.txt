{"about_the_course":"This course introduces students to a number of basic\nscientific principles underpinning cooking, cuisine preparation\nand the enjoyment of food.\nVarious topics with a strong basis in biology, chemistry and physics\napplications will be covered. These include the consumption of cooked food,\nphysiological and evolutionary control of the senses, geographic and cultural\ninfluences and the rationale behind cuisine preparation. Issues like coupling\nof senses to improve sense stimulation, altering flavor by chemical means, and\nmodification of the coloration to improve the appearance of dishes will be\ndiscussed in the course. Through video demonstrations of the scientific principles underlying cooking\npractices, students are expected to recognize the key ingredients and their\ncombination for preparing good healthy food. They will be able to: <span><br>\n</span><ol><li>develop an appreciation of the scientific\nbasis of various cuisine recipes;</li><li>develop their own recipes by integrating\nsome of the scientific principles into new dishes; as well as</li><li>recognize the influence of the material\nworld on human perception from the different senses, and thus</li><li>be able to continually take on cooking and\ndining as an art of integrating sciences.</li></ol>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/cbbe4e168e7006fef73ad1ca05ea95/KingYeung-Course-Banner.jpeg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1f/29cbc89d90f5c354bc5db353832fad/KingYeung-Course-Banner.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d2/605f63b0878b813ed3c6c1a28ec867/KingYeung-Course-Banner.jpg","video":"x2RRCgjNlYM","university-ids":["hkust"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/x2RRCgjNlYM/","id":216,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cb/c8497eeb219091d34206d663f73f27/ust_logo_16x16.png","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5b/4ba3ffda597d5f7d4630beefc58672/ust_logo_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":35,"location_city":"","location_country":"HK","location_lat":22.31049010000000000,"location":"Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong","primary_color":"#003366","abbr_name":"HKUST","website":"","description":"HKUST - A dynamic, international research university, in relentless pursuit of excellence, leading the advance of science and technology, and educating the new generation of front-runners for Asia and the world.","short_name":"hkust","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/496411dde8d728cfe1e95aba646d4c/seaView.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/19/697e3320bf893ca515c77a1520cb58/HKUST-Banner.jpg","location_state":"New Territories","name":"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/3a/37974779f7ad2a04626183c2f8951b/ustLogo.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ff/98ebf54773c4794af47c43516755e7/ustLogo.jpg","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":114.28362749999997000,"home_link":"","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/0a/3251bd0aca5bc1a90512cff8bc36ea/ustLogo.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"This course introduces students to elements of science behind cooking, cuisine preparation and the enjoyment of food.
