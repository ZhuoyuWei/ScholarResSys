{"about_the_course":"<p>Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics is a course in physical chemistry\nthat relates the microscopic properties of molecules to the macroscopic behavior\nof chemical systems. Quantized molecular energy levels and their use in the\nconstruction of molecular and ensemble partition functions is described.\nThermodynamic state functions, their dependence on the partition function, and\ntheir relationships with one another (as dictated by the three Laws of\nThermodynamics) are all examined in detail. Analysis and demonstration takes\nplace primarily in the context of ideal and real gases. This eight-week course\ncovers slightly more than half of a typical semester-long course in chemical\nthermodynamics. Typical topics to be addressed subsequently would be phase\nequilibria, liquids, solutions of non-electrolytes and electrolytes, and\nchemical reaction equilibria. <br></p><p>Students\n who successfully complete the course will be able to predict how \nchanges in molecular properties will influence the macroscopic behavior \nof those substances; they will understand the relationships between \nenergy, heat, and work, and be able to predict how much work can be \nextracted from a given chemical process under various sets of \nconditions; they will understand the role of entropy in physical and \nchemical processes; and they will be able to engineer conditions to make\n chemical reactions spontaneously favorable (or not). Students will also\n become adept with differential calculus as a tool to derive and \nmanipulate relationships between connected thermodynamic variables and \nstate functions.<br></p>\n<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ea/62eaf508705681803e580be5fe4552/Final-Train.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/50/edb5a49f0b862b982b945e54e4406e/Final-Train.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3d/2829770e40c961a1b3b7c7e7fbbae0/Final-Train.png","video":"tOEudSv6PtY","university-ids":["minnesota"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/tOEudSv6PtY/","id":381,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/32/051960873fd1cc2b6a315b80853ff2/minnesota.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UMNews","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f2/c0c3766390def44d6704f82d4d7955/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"UofMN","logo":"","background_color":"","id":50,"location_city":"Minneapolis","location_country":"US","location_lat":44.98333400000000000,"location":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","primary_color":"#7A0019","abbr_name":"Minnesota","website":"http://www.umn.edu/","description":"The University of Minnesota is among the largest public research universities in the country, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional students a multitude of opportunities for study and research.

He then commenced graduate work in organic synthesis at the University of Illinois, from which he earned his Ph.D. in 1988. His professional career began with four and one half years of service as an active-duty officer in the United States Army, which included a tour in Korea, research experience at Aberdeen Proving Ground, and combat duty in Operation Desert Storm. In 1992, Cramer began his academic career at the University of Minnesota, where he remains today. He is currently a Distinguished McKnight and University Teaching Professor and he holds the Elmore H. Northey Chair in the Department of Chemistry. In addition to his academic duties, he serves as the Editor of Theoretical Chemistry Accounts and as the North American Editor for the Journal of Physical Organic Chemistry. He has been recognized as a fellow by the American Chemical Society, as well as by the Alfred P. Sloan and John Simon Guggenheim foundations. Cramer is a recipient of the Arthur S. Flemming award, and he is also the author of the textbook Essentials of Computational Chemistry, Theories and Models, and of over 350 original research articles. His research interests encompass the development and application of models that include condensed-phase effects on structure and reactivity, the characterization of the electronic structures of organic and inorganic systems having frontier-orbital near degeneracies, and the application of computational methods for both catalyst and materials design, with special interest in water splitting and oxygen activation.","university_logo":"","course-ids":[970593,971775],"display":true,"recommended_background":"One year of college-level physics.
