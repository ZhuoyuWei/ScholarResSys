{"about_the_course":"While many people are fans of\njazz and understand that musicians are often \u201cmaking up\u201d the\nnotes they are playing during a performance, most people\u2014often\nincluding musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvising\u2014aren\u2019t\nclear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen. The\npurpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of modern improvisation and\nhow to go about mastering the different musical and mental skills involved. <br><br>Course author Gary Burton codifies a sought-after approach to improvisation that has been at the \ncore of Berklee College of Music's curriculum for decades. Students who complete\nthis course will know what to practice and how to practice the\nvarious aspects of improvising, in addition to understanding how the improviser spontaneously\ncommunicates to the listeners through their musical creations. \n\n\n\n<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0f/457e763eac0790be019fc29e90a153/jazz-large.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/38/498a30768dadc2f431b4e906ce2d92/jazz-large.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bb/dd4a127c81a87d90665a71334b88c0/jazz-large.jpg","video":"pTuR6lbSh68","university-ids":["berklee"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/pTuR6lbSh68/","id":218,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/06/ba75e5d5e53f93631ec53c157d68e4/berklee.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"berkleeonline","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/10/bb37f439a00f92524143611e504b27/favicon.png","website_facebook":"berkleeonline","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/885ec60036341f549253081e8784d1/berklee_logo.png","background_color":"","id":21,"location_city":"Boston","location_country":"US","location_lat":42.35843080000000000,"location":"Boston, MA","primary_color":"#0088CC","abbr_name":"Berkleemusic","website":"http://online.berklee.edu/","description":"Berklee College of Music was founded on the revolutionary principle that the best way to prepare students for careers in music is through the study and practice of contemporary music.
