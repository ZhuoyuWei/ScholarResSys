{"about_the_course":"Everything is connected: people, information, events and places, all the more so with the advent of online social media. A practical way of making sense of the tangle of connections is to analyze them as networks. In this course you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, computer science, economics, and physics. Online interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to tracing information diffusion and opinion formation.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/sna/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/sna/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/sna/large-icon.png","video":"AJGGiAb47S4","university-ids":["umich"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/AJGGiAb47S4/","id":38,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/75/07a2c2f614597144b29c9e63bbee75/U-M_Coursera_Logo-2.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"umich","china_mirror":3,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/50/52265d555e7bf0b0b86f7a1a07a183/favicon-umich.ico","website_facebook":"universityofmichigan","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/99/263203c94842c44bcf757c4a801e8f/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":3,"location_city":"Ann Arbor","location_country":"US","location_lat":42.28082560000000000,"location":"Ann Arbor, MI","primary_color":"#002E5F","abbr_name":"Michigan","website":"http://www.umich.edu/","description":"The University of Michigan is a public research university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the United States.","short_name":"umich","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/70c6a457583d267a869cb6555b4de5/DIL-17Apr12_AT150a_EDIT_TO_2.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"user/um","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/36/1d953d8380a15d8eb0d307c7cde0bb/banner-umich.jpg","location_state":"MI","name":"University of Michigan","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/70/de505d47be7d3a063b51b6f856a6e2/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/26/23ecbedd1043250eab7d1b0a41696b/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_600x600.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6b/fce84d27ebcd493f839f14df253541/New-Block-M-Stacked-Blue-295C_.svg","location_lng":-83.74303780000002000,"home_link":"","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/05/1a1f4b975bf71dba0ac79042ed651e/U-M_LogoSmHoriz_200x48.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"This course will use social network analysis, both its theory and computational tools, to make sense of the social and information networks that have been fueled and rendered accessible by the internet.","description":"","short_name":"sna","target_audience":1,"faq":"<ul>\n<li><strong>What tools will we be using in this class?</strong>\n<p>We will be using <a href=\"http://gephi.org\">Gephi</a> for visualization and analysis.
