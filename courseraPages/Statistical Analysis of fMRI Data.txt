{"about_the_course":"In this course we will explore the intersection of statistics and&nbsp;functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, which is a&nbsp;non-invasive technique for studying brain activity. We will discuss&nbsp;the analysis of fMRI data, from its acquisition to its use in locating&nbsp;brain activity, making inference about brain connectivity and&nbsp;predictions about psychological or disease states. A standard fMRI&nbsp;study gives rise to massive amounts of noisy data with a complicated&nbsp;spatio-temporal correlation structure. Statistics plays a crucial role&nbsp;in understanding the nature of the data and obtaining relevant results&nbsp;that can be used and interpreted by neuroscientists.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/99/e7cc1626344d9b8f671a81a7d12acb/fMRI-02.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0c/6bee654dfee703ac99b66a22a0d8c7/fMRI-02.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/1f41bfeced0e9b7f970702cb397195/fMRI-02.jpg","video":"BacukiGxXng","university-ids":["jhu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/BacukiGxXng/","id":790,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/0fb2d85007ca7f6d671b73e64a44d6/nursing.logo.large.horizontal.blue.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"JohnsHopkins","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico","website_facebook":"johnshopkinsuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png","location_lat":39.29038480000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Baltimore","location_country":"US","id":8,"location":"Baltimore, MD","primary_color":"#0061AA","abbr_name":"Johns Hopkins","website":"http://www.jhu.edu/","description":"The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.","short_name":"jhu","location_state":"MD","website_youtube":"johnshopkins","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg","name":"Johns Hopkins University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/229e9cabab40da92cdd0fc46cd7e06/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/4b4ca39464d8fd3a75bf8a68d0a1d9/JHUNewSquare.png","display":true,"location_lng":-76.61218930000001000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","square_logo_svg":""}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Explore the intersection of statistics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a non-invasive technique for studying brain activity.
