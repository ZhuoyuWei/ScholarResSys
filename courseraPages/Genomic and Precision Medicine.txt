{"about_the_course":"<p><span>Precision\nmedicine has the potential to change fundamentally how health care is\npracticed, but requires a health care workforce that understands the\ncomplexities of this field. One important component of Precision Medicine is\nthe use of an individual\u2019s genomic information to offer targeted treatment,\ntailored to the individual. Our course aims to provide\nparticipants with some baseline knowledge of genomics, an overview of the clinical\napplications of genomic medicine, the skills to evaluate the clinical validity\nand utility of new tests, and an appreciation of the associated ethical and\nsocial issues inherent in this field<span>.\u00a0 </span></span></p>\n\n\n\n<span>The\ncourse is geared toward practicing health care providers, although it should be\naccessible to anyone with a background in the biological sciences and a basic\nunderstanding of genetics.\u00a0 It is\ndesigned to be succinct and clinically-focused, offering both conceptual and\npractical information about real-world applications of genomics.\u00a0 The first two lessons offer a basic primer on\nmolecular genomics relevant to the individual patient as well as to patient\npopulations. The remaining five lessons focus on five applications of genomics\nand present the material as case studies, highlighting the strengths,\nlimitations, and issues that arise in the use of each test. </span><br><br><br><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/10/6e99bbcd317ac2fe26120fdd20ea99/genomiccourselogocropped.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/50/8ab0d0d49c390ba89b6c46f49d84c1/genomiccourselogocropped.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/5ecd1d117ffb5d8543448c8e22c505/genomiccourselogocropped.jpg","video":"47ZLHr0uv0g","university-ids":["ucsf"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/47ZLHr0uv0g/","id":1044,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e1/a7f601ed89820976ce747332b7097a/ucsfteal.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UCSF","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/0c/2907cc15f65f9357cbaadd020c7949/favicon-ucsf.ico","website_facebook":"UCSF","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/3c/323ac20ee0407891fe2a0828ae6744/ucsfteal.png","background_color":"","id":10,"location_city":"SF","location_country":"US","location_lat":37.77492950000000000,"location":"San Francisco, CA","primary_color":"#009999","abbr_name":"UCSF","website":"http://www.ucsf.edu/","description":"The University of California, San Francisco, is dedicated to promoting health worldwide through advanced biomedical research, graduate-level education in the life sciences and health professions, and high-quality patient care.
