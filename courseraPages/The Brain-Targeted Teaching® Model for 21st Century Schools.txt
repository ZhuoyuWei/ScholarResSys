{"about_the_course":"<p>New findings from the neuro- and cognitive sciences have the potential to inform classroom instruction and influence educational practices for children at all developmental levels. &nbsp;Translating this research to practice, however, is often challenging for educational practitioners. &nbsp;This course will offer practical application of research by linking it with the Brain-Targeted Teaching\u00ae Model (BTT)\u2014a pedagogical framework for using research in the neuro- and cognitive sciences as well as research-based effective instruction to guide teachers in planning, implementing, and assessing a sound program of instruction for all learners.&nbsp;</p><p>Participants in\nthe course will examine research from the brain sciences that can inform\neducational practice and be able to implement research findings using the\ninstructional framework, The Brain-Targeted Teaching\u00ae Model. This model\npresents six stages, or \u201cbrain targets\u201d of the teaching and learning process.\nThe components include (1) establishing the emotional climate for learning, (2)\ncreating the physical learning environment, (3) designing the learning\nexperience, (4) teaching for the mastery of content, skills, and concepts, (5)\nteaching for the extension and application of knowledge, and (6) evaluating\nlearning. A central theme of the model is the integration of the arts to foster\nretention of new information, conceptual development, and higher-order thinking\nand creative problem-solving.</p><p><u><b>Course\nobjectives:</b></u></p><p></p><ul><li>Describe themes in brain research that can inform\neducational practice consistent with the Brain-Targeted Teaching\u00ae Model.</li><li>Describe how emotional and physical learning\nenvironments affect learning.</li><li>Identify themes in brain research\nthat educators can apply as they design instruction; teach for mastery of\ncontent, skills, and processes; design activities to apply and extend\nknowledge; and evaluate learning.</li></ul><p></p>\n\n<p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d0/bb20f645b9ec6dd0145b3f73e416b7/BTTmodel.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e1/57bbe4cf8922fbb5a256e4eb628de6/BTTmodel.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/21/5568251fb72559764d7f6f806dcac1/BTTmodel.png","video":"","university-ids":["jhu"],"video_baseurl":"","id":637,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/0fb2d85007ca7f6d671b73e64a44d6/nursing.logo.large.horizontal.blue.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"JohnsHopkins","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico","website_facebook":"johnshopkinsuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png","background_color":"","id":8,"location_city":"Baltimore","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.29038480000000000,"location":"Baltimore, MD","primary_color":"#0061AA","abbr_name":"Johns Hopkins","website":"http://www.jhu.edu/","description":"The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.","short_name":"jhu","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"johnshopkins","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg","location_state":"MD","name":"Johns Hopkins University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/229e9cabab40da92cdd0fc46cd7e06/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/4b4ca39464d8fd3a75bf8a68d0a1d9/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-76.61218930000001000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Improve the outcomes in your classroom through practical applications of neuro- and cognitive science research.
