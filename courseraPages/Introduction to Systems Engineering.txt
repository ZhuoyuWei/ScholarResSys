{"about_the_course":"Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary approach to design, implementation and evaluation that holds the key to the successful development of complex human-made systems. This course explores a framework encapsulating the entire systems engineering discipline, clearly showing where the multitude of associated activities fits within the overall effort and how the activities relate to one another.\u00a0 Systems engineering is a very broad discipline, so we also discuss how the concepts and procedures could be applied to individual projects. A new theme will be explored each week using presentations to introduce and synthesise key concepts, examples to simulate authentic contexts, and structured activities to guide your learning. <br><br>The course is relevant to all professions associated with the introduction of complex human-made systems: project managers, engineers, quality assurance representatives, integrated logistic support practitioners, operators, managers, maintainers, and so on, from students to professionals, from novices to experienced practitioners, from technical to non-technical people. <br><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/18/0ae606afb5f38a243b006c4bf4addd/iStock_000004538031Small.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/96/1342be2648d28955ec71ae7f126289/iStock_000004538031Small.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/0200561c1a957c813723acd2e37885/iStock_000004538031Small.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["unsw"],"video_baseurl":"","id":1143,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7f/c5f757444e56414746fa75cf531897/unsw_logo_200x48.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"unsw","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/0a/5c6ae77f9441ba1b3cded9a5ae7bb1/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"unsw","logo":"","background_color":"","id":155,"location_city":"Kensington","location_country":"AU","location_lat":-33.91741000000000000,"location":"UNSW, High Street, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","primary_color":"#00568E","abbr_name":"UNSW","website":"http://www.unsw.edu.au/","description":"The University of New South Wales (UNSW), based in Sydney, was established in 1949 and is one of Australia\u2019s leading research and teaching universities with more than 50,000 students from over 120 countries.
