What are carbohydrates, fats and proteins and how do we choose the healthiest of these? What is a glycemic index? Learn tricks for controlling\n    portion sizes while maintaining satisfaction; cooking continues with more\n    healthy breakfast alternatives, an easy dinner all in one dish, and a simple,\n    (gluten-free) cake for special occasions.\n    <br>\n    <br>Week three: How to pack a quick, healthy lunch for a child and why this\n    is so important; how to shop for fruits and vegetables and navigate the supermarket for better health; what are the benefits of the family meal?
