{"about_the_course":"Analysis of Algorithms aims to enable precise quantitative predictions of the properties of large combinatorial structures. The theory has emerged over recent decades as essential both for the scientific analysis of algorithms in computer science and for the study of scientific models in many other disciplines, including probability theory, statistical physics, computational biology and information theory. This course covers recurrence relations, generating functions, asymptotics, and fundamental structures such as trees, permutations, strings, tries, words, and mappings, in the context of applications to the analysis of algorithms.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b8/a99c90ef60cd3677af72de4b128ec8/aofa-logo.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/45/e34eeed7950dbc63909ad29a7ffbce/aofa-logo.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/595ad15d7c62645b62e5f55852d47b/aofa-logo.png","video":"HICqzbexJlg","university-ids":["princeton"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/HICqzbexJlg/","id":688,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"princeton","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/29daf4b768e1aa467202d4d2dcf8d8/favicon-princeton.ico","website_facebook":"PrincetonU","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/94/cc9200e336d38ce029873b13cbe93b/logo-princeton-front.png","background_color":"","id":4,"location_city":"Princeton","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.35729760000000000,"location":"Princeton, NJ","primary_color":"#BA632D","abbr_name":"Princeton","website":"http://www.princeton.edu/","description":"Princeton University is a private research university located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.
