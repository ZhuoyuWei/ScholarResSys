{"about_the_course":"Born in an age ruled by monarchs, Thomas\nJefferson thought that power ought to belong to those who possessed \u201cvirtue and\ntalent\u201d rather than to aristocrats who had inherited it. He rejected the power\nof kings in favor of ordinary people, believing that all men are created equal\nand possess inherent natural rights. Jefferson became a powerful spokesman for\na revolutionary generation of Americans who created a new nation based on these\nradical ideas. Thomas Jefferson remains today a pivotal figure in\nAmerican history whose influence continues to be felt nearly two centuries\nafter his death, both in the United States and around the world.&nbsp; This\ncourse will offer an introduction to Jefferson\u2019s thought, focusing on several\nkey ideas and themes that engaged Jefferson throughout his public career and\nprivate life.&nbsp; We will address the three achievements that Jefferson asked\nto be listed on his tombstone by discussing his roles in writing the Declaration\nof Independence, in advocating religious freedom, and in advancing the cause of\neducation by founding the University of Virginia.&nbsp; We will also seek to\nunderstand what Jefferson meant when he proclaimed that \u201cthe earth belongs to\nthe living.\u201d&nbsp; And, crucially, we will explore Jefferson\u2019s lifelong\nrelationship with the institution of slavery.<br><br><p>To\nunderstand Jefferson\u2019s ideas and why they continue to be relevant today, our\napproach in each lecture will be to situate Jefferson in the context of his own\ntime and place.&nbsp; Jefferson lived for many years in different\nplaces\u2014Philadelphia, New York, Paris, and Washington D.C., to name but a\nfew\u2014but there is little doubt that he considered his home, Monticello, and the\nnearby town of Charlottesville, in central Virginia, to be the center of his\nworld.&nbsp; In this course, produced by the University of Virginia in close\npartnership with the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, we will explore how\nJefferson\u2019s identification with Monticello and the surrounding area influenced\nhim as he formulated ideas that have made a global impact.&nbsp; After\ncompleting the course it should be clear not only why Jefferson's legacy is\nessential to understanding American history, but also why UNESCO has designated\nJefferson\u2019s Monticello and the University of Virginia as a World Heritage Site.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/83/92701b94ec68ff7bffb6da07751e57/jefferson.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/97/f3fe0f207b2ee7a2de1bfd048a56f4/jefferson.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/88/da9a2fc7550b8593d074defd33211d/jefferson.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["uva"],"video_baseurl":"","id":473,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/8cf6b18a752fa9ba66be05d904571d/favicon-uva.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d4/a193b107772ef0132965d063f454f5/uvalogo-coursera.png","background_color":"","id":18,"location_city":"Charlottesville","location_country":"US","location_lat":38.02930590000000000,"location":"Charlottesville, VA","primary_color":"#3565A6","abbr_name":"Virginia","website":"","description":"The University of Virginia is distinctive among institutions of higher education.
