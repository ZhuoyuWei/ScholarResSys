{"about_the_course":"The Music of the Beatles will track the musical development of the band, starting from the earliest days in Liverpool and Hamburg, moving through the excitement of Beatlemania, the rush of psychedelia, and the maturity of Abbey Road. While the focus will be on the music, we will also consider how recording techniques, the music business, the music of other artists, and the culture of the 1960s affected John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they created the Beatles repertory.<br><br>There is probably no band or artist that has had more written about their music than the Beatles. There are many good books on the band's biography, several insider accounts offering glimpses behind the scenes, books that interpret the meaning of the songs, and even books that catalog dates and people regarding the band. This course will try to synthesize much of that information into an account of the Beatles' development as musicians and songwriters.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0e/61a0fd462aa2524f71915233b3530b/Beatles-red-legal-safe-copy.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/70/bdf9536b2df1585b073b561f39bf83/Beatles-red-legal-safe-copy.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6c/fda73132d8f0f386504e4731297020/Beatles-red-legal-safe-copy.jpg","video":"yBG4-TtteUE","university-ids":["rochester"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/yBG4-TtteUE/","id":936,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7e/6c91cdbbbf15462557b3972acfb6b2/wideUR.2colRGB.v1-01.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UofR","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"University.of.Rochester","logo":"","background_color":"","id":60,"location_city":"Rochester","location_country":"US","location_lat":43.16103000000000000,"location":"Rochester, NY","primary_color":"#003F72","abbr_name":"Rochester","website":"http://www.rochester.edu/","description":"The University of Rochester is one of the nation's leading private universities.

The Beatles as pop craftsmen. Study of cover versions at Cavern and Hamburg shows, <i>Please Please Me</i>, <i>With the Beatles</i>, and the singles from this period.<br><br>Week Two: Success in America and the world. The Beatles begin to move toward the artist model. Music from the two movies, <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> and <i>Help!</i>, <i>Beatles For Sale</i>, and singles from this period. From this point on we will closely follow particular authorship of songs, keeping track of John, Paul, and George as individual songwriters.<br><br>Week Three: Pop maturity. Increased experimentation, still mostly within the context of the pop single. The increasingly important role of the recording studio and recording techniques and innovations.&nbsp;<i>Rubber Soul</i>, <i>Revolver</i>, and singles from this period.<br><br>Week Four: Psychedelia. The artist model in full bloom. The rise of importance of the album and idea-driven projects. \"Penny Lane,\" \"Strawberry Fields,\" <i>Sgt.

Dowlding, <i>Beatlesongs</i>, Touchstone, 1989. A great one-volume account of all the Beatles albums and singles, organized chronologically and in running order, providing song info and Beatle comments. A perfect place to start.<br><br><b>Additional references:</b><br><br><i>The Beatles Anthology</i> (5-DVD set), Apple, 1995. The Beatles story told as by the band. It is interesting to compare the story as they tell it with the many other band biographies that are out there. There is also a book that provides the full interviews from this project, and this is an excellent resource as well. Other insider accounts are provided by George Martin, Geoff Emerick, Geoffrey Ellis, and Peter Brown, as well as by Brian Epstein in his autobiography (ghost written by Derek Taylor).<br><br>Walter Everett, <i>The Beatles As Musicians</i> (two volumes), Oxford University Press, 1999 and 2001. Without question the best books on the technical aspects of the Beatles music available. Highly recommended, especially for those with music training.<br><br>Mark Lewissohn, <i>The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions</i>, Sterling, 2013. After years of being out of print, this excellent book on the details of Beatles recording sessions is due to be published in an inexpensive paperback version in October 2013.<br><br>Andy Babiuk, <i>Beatles Gear</i>, Backbeat, 2009. For the gearheads out there, this book gives you all the details you need on the guitars, amps, drums, and other gear the band used in the 1960s.<br><br><i>The Beatles Complete Scores</i>, Hal Leonard, 1993. While no knowledge of musical notation is required for this course, if you can read music this is a great resource. This volume transcribes every track recorded by the band and presents it in score format. There are errors, but overall this is a crucial resource for those interested in the technical details of the music.","instructor":null,"categories":[{"id":18,"name":"Music, Film, and Audio","mailing_list_id":null,"short_name":"music","description":""}],"estimated_class_workload":"2-4 hours/week","name":"The Music of the Beatles","language":"en","university_logo_st":null,"video_id":null,"courses":[{"grading_policy_distinction":"","ace_track_price_display":null,"signature_track_certificate_design_id":null,"ace_semester_hours":null,"start_day":9,"duration_string":"6 weeks","signature_track_last_chance_time":null,"signature_track_additional_notes":null,"certificate_ready_user_id":null,"id":971360,"start_month":2,"certificate_description":"","start_date_string":null,"chegg_session_id":"","signature_track_regular_price":null,"grades_release_date":null,"certificates_ready":false,"signature_track_price":null,"statement_design_id":87,"signature_track_registration_open":false,"topic_id":936,"eligible_for_signature_track":false,"start_date":null,"status":1,"start_year":2014,"signature_track_certificate_combined_signature":"","end_date":null,"notified_subscribers":false,"instructors":[2599979],"end_of_class_emails_sent":null,"active":false,"eligible_for_certificates":true,"signature_track_certificate_signature_blurb":"","deployed":true,"ace_close_date":null,"name":"001","textbooks":[],"signature_track_open_time":null,"eligible_for_ACE":false,"grading_policy_normal":"","ace_open_date":null,"signature_track_last_refund_date":null,"home_link":"https://class.coursera.org/beatles-001/","creator_id":1488348,"proctored_exam_completion_date":null,"university_logo":null,"signature_track_close_time":null,"auth_review_completion_date":null}],"about_the_instructor":"","university_logo":"","course-ids":[971360],"display":true,"recommended_background":"No previous musical training is required.
