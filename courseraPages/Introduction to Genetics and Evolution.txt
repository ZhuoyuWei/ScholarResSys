{"about_the_course":"Introduction to Genetics and Evolution is a college-level class being offered simultaneously to new students at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://biology.duke.edu/\">Duke University</a>. The course gives interested people a very basic overview of some principles behind these very fundamental areas of biology. \u00a0We often hear about new \"genome sequences,\" commercial kits that can tell you about your ancestry (including pre-human) from your DNA or disease predispositions, debates about the truth of evolution, why animals behave the way they do, and how people found \"genetic evidence for natural selection.\"\u00a0 This course provides the basic biology you need to understand all of these issues better, tries to clarify some misconceptions, and tries to prepare students for future, more advanced coursework in Biology. \u00a0No prior coursework is assumed.<br><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/geneticsevolution/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/geneticsevolution/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/geneticsevolution/large-icon.png","video":"oWtkfohIG80","university-ids":["duke"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/oWtkfohIG80/","id":56,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/65/b1eae360095757f04b8bfda5fdbb62/Duke_University_Logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"DukeU","china_mirror":3,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/500c9f41731d797a0e108a4edd8bc1/favicon-duke.ico","website_facebook":"DukeUniv","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/67/20d9fca42bddac2034668d7b589cad/dukewidelogo_vert.png","background_color":"","id":7,"location_city":"Durham","location_country":"US","location_lat":35.99403290000000000,"location":"Durham, NC, USA","primary_color":"#003366","abbr_name":"Duke","website":"http://duke.edu/","description":"Home of the Blue Devils, Duke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

A few introductory genetics topics are covered somewhat quickly, such that those who did not learn basic heredity in grade-school may struggle with the pace, but students who had literally no biology have succeeded in understanding the material from just this treatment and a little bit of internet searching.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>What if I don't believe in evolution? What if it conflicts with my faith?</strong>\n<p>The course presents evidence for evolution in the first lecture, and delves into extensive detail on evolutionary processes later. Enrolled parties need not in any way modify or abandon their belief system, but test questions will be based on the material as it is covered in the lectures.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Will the lectures cover macroevolution, or talk about the diversity of past (e.g., dinosaurs) or present life?</strong>\n<p>The present version does not cover macroevolution or the diversity of life. There will not be anything about dinosaurs. The evolution topics covered in the present course are largely confined to \"microevolution,\" though we hope to add some new topics spanning macroevolution to future course iterations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Will the lectures cover any molecular biology, or applications like PCR or next-generation DNA sequencing?</strong>\n<p>No. The genetics lectures are limited to basic transmission genetics, recombination, genetic mapping, and basic quantitative genetics.
