{"about_the_course":"Large-scale biology projects such as the sequencing of the human genome \nand gene expression surveys using RNA-seq, microarrays and other \ntechnologies have created a wealth of data for biologists. However, the \nchallenge facing scientists is analyzing and even accessing these data \nto extract useful information pertaining to the system being studied. \nThis course focuses on employing existing bioinformatic resources \u2013 \nmainly web-based programs and databases \u2013 to access the wealth of data \nto answer questions relevant to the average biologist, and is highly \nhands-on. <br><br>Topics covered include multiple sequence alignments, \nphylogenetics, gene expression data analysis, and protein interaction \nnetworks, in two separate parts. <br><br>The first part, <b>Bioinformatic Methods I</b>, deals with databases, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, selection analysis, RNA-seq, and metagenomics. <br><br>The second part, <b>Bioinformatic Methods II</b>,\n covers motif searching, protein-protein interactions, structural \nbioinformatics, gene expression data analysis, and cis-element \npredictions. <br><br>This pair of courses is useful to any student \nconsidering graduate school in the biological sciences, as well as \nstudents considering molecular medicine.<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/32/11e2f53c30ecf81555fbb3a928658e/Thumbnail2.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b1/c0832f88bff8c67e24b6f67f92f87e/Thumbnail2.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/7a/235c6bb6a70c2c6252161733fa1c12/Thumbnail2.png","video":"Dk4BV8H2-rk","university-ids":["utoronto"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/Dk4BV8H2-rk/","id":1069,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"uoftnews","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8e/773801b870a0cb946698134a77417d/favicon-utoronto.ico","website_facebook":"universitytoronto","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/78/334b4573e06c876cff8e2484f082d7/logo-utoronto-front.png","background_color":"","id":11,"location_city":"Toronto","location_country":"CA","location_lat":43.65322600000000000,"location":"Toronto, ON, Canada","primary_color":"#1C3361","abbr_name":"U of T","website":"http://www.utoronto.ca/","description":"Established in 1827, the University of Toronto has one of the strongest research and teaching faculties in North America, presenting top students at all levels with an intellectual environment unmatched in depth and breadth on any other Canadian campus.","short_name":"utoronto","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/84/774219ef720c726661c682cda7838a/UofT-Banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"universitytoronto","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6f/9a578312b814f8aeaf942f4f248447/banner-utoronto.jpg","location_state":"ON","name":"University of Toronto","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/04/1df8943d27a485a986a3ebf10c83d9/UofT-Crest-Square.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dd/cf4561b10afb34d449bb9574ecbca3/UofT-Crest-Square.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/06/0e2fff91e34df097bbb12ecd57c0af/UofT-Crest-Square.svg","location_lng":-79.38318429999998000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e0/c3219157fdcd439fb3b765c4b723e5/UofT-Crest-Wide.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Use of available (mainly web-based) programs for analyzing biological data.
