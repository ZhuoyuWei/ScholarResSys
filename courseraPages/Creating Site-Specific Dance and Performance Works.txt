{"about_the_course":"<p>This course will look into the process of creating live site-specific choreography and performance works from conception, production to performance. Site-specific dance/performance is work created in response to a particular place or site, and is inspired by its architecture/design,\n    the history and/or current use. We will investigate&nbsp;urban, architectural and environmental inspired site projects ranging from large-scale to small (guerrilla) style productions. We will&nbsp;delineate definitions of site-specificity, and&nbsp;look\n    across the history of the field, focusing primarily on dance.</p>\n<p>Specific techniques and approaches towards generating site-inspired choreography, developed over the last 25 years by site artist Stephan Koplowitz will be introduced. Aspects of navigating technical issues (lighting, sound, media) and a primer\n    on producing (budgeting, obtaining permissions, insurance, fundraising, audience/event design) will also be covered. \n</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ef/fbb99bf89f0a820c09a30d70ac153d/STEPHAN_K.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d7/9d7d396bfc35bdf06530423edcdcca/STEPHAN_K.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e9/bfb17bca07d0a30a12ac5c31774aed/STEPHAN_K.jpg","video":"BmhABRE-8Cw","university-ids":["calarts"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/BmhABRE-8Cw/","id":442,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/63/7a864aeb70a49fdc5213ff5e7c1a3a/calarts-logo-orange-01.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"calarts","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"calarts","logo":"","location_lat":34.38981620000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Santa Clarita","location_country":"US","id":59,"location":"Valencia, Santa Clarita, CA","primary_color":"#0090D0","abbr_name":"CalArts","website":"http://calarts.edu/","description":"The California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) has earned an international reputation as the leading college of the visual and performing arts in the United States, and was recently ranked as America\u2019s top college for students in the arts by Newsweek/The Daily Beast.
