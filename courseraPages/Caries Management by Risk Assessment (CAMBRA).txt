{"about_the_course":"Dental Caries (tooth decay) is a bacterially based disease that progresses\nwhen acid produced by bacterial action on dietary fermentable carbohydrates\ntravels into the tooth and dissolves the carbonated hydroxyapatite mineral.\n\u00a0This process is<span> called demineralization.<br>\n<br>\nPathological factors, including acidogenic bacteria, salivary dysfunction, and\ndietary carbohydrates are related to caries progression.\u00a0 Protective factors, which include\nantibacterials, salivary calcium, phosphate and proteins, salivary flow, and\nfluoride in saliva can balance, prevent or reverse dental caries through a\nprocess of remineralization.\u00a0\nRemineralization is a natural and reliable repair mechanism for\nnon-cavitated carious lesions.<br>\n<br>\nThis course will provide the scientific basis behind the \u201ccaries balance\u201d\nconcept, which is the key to caries management by risk assessment in clinical\npractice.\u00a0 If pathological factors\nprevail caries progresses.\u00a0 If protective\nfactors prevail the caries process is halted or reversed.<br>\n<br>\nThe course will present tools to implement \u00a0CAMBRA, \u201ccaries management by risk assessment,\u201d\nin your clinical setting.\u00a0 It can be in\nimplemented medical and dental settings, and can benefit children and adults of\nall ages. Implementation in dental practice provides patients with genuine hope\nand success for the management of their oral health.\u00a0 It is a practice builder for dentistry.</span>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/69/be481ce5e3fd0fe06d1c8296382cc3/newlogo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e1/ef87539b4b04d28363c65aa39aa741/newlogo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/21/7006dc0e394b4cd80a7d1283ab9d87/newlogo.jpg","video":"Tc9xq5fVyYY","university-ids":["ucsf"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/Tc9xq5fVyYY/","id":357,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e1/a7f601ed89820976ce747332b7097a/ucsfteal.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UCSF","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/0c/2907cc15f65f9357cbaadd020c7949/favicon-ucsf.ico","website_facebook":"UCSF","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/3c/323ac20ee0407891fe2a0828ae6744/ucsfteal.png","background_color":"","id":10,"location_city":"SF","location_country":"US","location_lat":37.77492950000000000,"location":"San Francisco, CA","primary_color":"#009999","abbr_name":"UCSF","website":"http://www.ucsf.edu/","description":"The University of California, San Francisco, is dedicated to promoting health worldwide through advanced biomedical research, graduate-level education in the life sciences and health professions, and high-quality patient care.
