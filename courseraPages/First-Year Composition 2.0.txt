We recommend that you plan 30-to-60-minute\nblocks, so that you have time to reflect between sessions when you\u2019re working\non a text, visual, or oral presentation.\n<br>\n<br><b>What are the most useful things I'll learn if I take this class?</b>\nYou\u2019ll\ndevelop a stronger sense of process (how to approach and complete tasks),\nleading to increased confidence in completing and assessing written, visual,\nand oral communication projects.\n<br>\n<br><b>What resources will I need for this class?</b>\nBeyond a positive attitude,\ntime to do the readings and assignments, and a willingness to work, you\nwill need regular access to a computer, a connection to the Internet, and\nbasic software for doing written, visual, and oral activities. While you\ncan use commercial software if you already own it, all of the software\nyou need is free and available online (a list of some software resources\nis on the syllabus). You do not need to buy a textbook; instead, you will\nbe referred to free, online texts\u2014Writing Commons and the PurdueOWL.\n<br>\n<br><b>Will I receive transferable college course credit?</b>\nThis course is\nintended to introduce you to principles and practices of first-year composition.\nIt is not intended as a substitute for a for-credit composition course\nat any college or university. Even though this course is not intended to\nbe given college credit, it can demonstrate that you have learned a great\ndeal. To keep a record of your accomplishments in this course, you should\ncreate a portfolio of your written, visual, and oral assignments. At some\ncolleges and universities, your portfolio may form a portion of a case\nyou might make for potential transfer credit. Every college has its own\npolicy for acceptance of transfer or examination credit.\n<br>\n<br><b>Will I get feedback on my written work?</b> Yes. You will receive peer\nassessments of your work. In addition, Professor Head and her teaching\nteam will model effective feedback practices so class members can respond\nproductively to one another. Most important for developing competence and\nconfidence, you will learn how to assess your own work. We will also hold\nweekly virtual discussions and use selected projects for examples (anonymously\nand with your permission).\n<br>\n<br><b>Will this course provide instruction on grammar?</b> No. Mechanics (for\nexample, punctuation, capitalization, spelling) and grammar are important,\nso you\u2019ll be given references to check mechanics and grammar. However,\nthis course focuses on creating effective writing, visuals, and oral presentations.\n<br>\n<br><b>Is the course appropriate if a student is not very proficient in the English language?</b> This\ncourse is about composing in English, so all course work must be completed\nin English. You will need English fluency to be successful in the course.\nBecause we welcome cultural and linguistic diversity, part of our discussions\nwill focus on the ways different people use language and the different\nexpectations people bring to communication.","category-ids":["humanities"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"<b>Course Outline</b>\n\n<br>Week One:&nbsp;Establishing Concepts, Practices, and Learning Goals\n<br>Assignments: Self- Assessment Surveys &amp;&nbsp;Personal Benchmark Statement<br>\n<br>Weeks Two &amp; Three:&nbsp;Written Communication\n<div>Major Assignment \u2013 Personal Philosophy Essay</div>\n<br>Weeks Four &amp; Five: Visual Communication&nbsp;<br>Major Assignment \u2013&nbsp;Personal Philosophy Visual&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;\n<br>Weeks Six &amp; Seven: &nbsp;Oral&nbsp;<br>Major Assignment \u2013&nbsp;Personal Philosophy Recorded Presentation&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Week Eight:&nbsp;Reflection&nbsp;\n<br>Assignment \u2013 Re-visit the Self-Assessment Surveys and Personal Benchmark Statement","course_format":"This class consists of two short introductory videos (a welcome video\nand a technology video), 24 ten-minute videos (three videos per week),\nplus approximately eight 20-to-30-minute recorded \"Hangout\" discussion sessions.\nThese videos are complemented by additional written, oral, and visual materials;\nstudent activities; and web-based assessments.","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5b/34fea429e8a72bb6c4478b88b8a88a/LMC-icon5.png","suggested_readings":"See course syllabus for required and suggested readings.
