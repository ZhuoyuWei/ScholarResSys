{"about_the_course":"<p>Digital images and videos are everywhere these days \u2013 in thousands of\nscientific (e.g., astronomical, bio-medical), consumer, industrial, and\nartistic applications. Moreover they come in a wide range of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum - from visible light and infrared to gamma rays and\nbeyond. The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an\nincredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software\ndevelopers, and practicing scientists.\u00a0\u00a0\nDigital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia\ntechnology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of\nimage and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer\nduring acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car),\nand the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos\nonline, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!),\nfor economical storage and efficient transmission.\u00a0</p>\n\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.\u00a0 We will provide a mathematical framework to describe and analyze images and videos as two- and three-dimensional signals in the spatial, spatio-temporal, and frequency domains. In this class not only will you learn the theory behind fundamental processing tasks including image/video enhancement, recovery, and compression - but you will also learn how to perform these key processing tasks in practice using state-of-the-art techniques and tools. We will introduce and use a wide variety of such tools \u2013 from optimization toolboxes to statistical techniques. Emphasis on the special role sparsity plays in modern image and video processing will also be given.\u00a0 In all cases, example images and videos pertaining to specific application domains will be utilized.<br><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3e/8166be0abcc2a8803d91b7aa55135c/logo_aggelos.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bf/d1a80b022b8abf215d1f977c071c2f/logo_aggelos.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6d/c49bbac1cbaecf9a2ff557e517634c/logo_aggelos.jpg","video":"y1566JpskAI","university-ids":["northwestern"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/y1566JpskAI/","id":485,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/26/0b57b2a31bf4990787cf7e2d75cad9/NU_Logo_purpleCMYK2.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"NorthwesternU","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"NorthwesternU","logo":"","location_lat":42.04114140000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Evanston","location_country":"US","id":54,"location":"Evanston, IL","primary_color":"#480058","abbr_name":"Northwestern","website":"http://www.northwestern.edu/","description":"Founded in 1851, Northwestern University is a private research and teaching university with an enrollment of approximately 8,000 full-time undergraduate students, 8,000 full-time graduate and professional students, and 2,000 part-time students on campuses in Evanston and Chicago, Illinois, and Doha, Qatar.
