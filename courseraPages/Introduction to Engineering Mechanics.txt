Whiteman, P.E. is the Director of the Office of Student Services and\nSenior Academic Professional in the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering\nat Georgia Tech.\u00a0 In addition to his\nadministrative responsibilities, he teaches in the areas of engineering\nmechanics, dynamics and vibration, and engineering design.\u00a0 He\nalso conducts the Woodruff School Teaching Fellows Program which provides\nworkshops for faculty colleagues to improve teaching skills and enhance\nlearning environments. Dr. Whiteman is involved in scholarship\nand research in the areas of engineering education, and teaching and learning\ninitiatives.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Whiteman joined\nGeorgia Tech after serving as an assistant, associate, and full professor at\nthe United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. During that time,\nDr. Whiteman served as the Mechanical Engineering Program Director for an\nundergraduate program with approximately twenty-five faculty members in the\nfields of mechanical systems, thermal sciences, aeronautical systems, and\nengineering design. </p>\n\nDr. Whiteman served 24 years in the United\nStates Army prior to arriving at Georgia Tech in 2003. He retired from military\nservice as an officer in the Corps of Engineers at the rank of Colonel. His\nmilitary field assignments culminated in his command of the 577th Engineering\nBattalion at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.","university_logo":"","course-ids":[970353,971160],"display":true,"recommended_background":"You\nshould have a background in basic calculus, and physics covering classical\nmechanics."}
