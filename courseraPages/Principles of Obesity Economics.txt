In his research, he combines his knowledge of economic analysis with clinical and epidemiological insights from his colleagues to produce burden of disease and cost-effectiveness analyses that bring the tools of economic decision making to policy-makers. He has focused on community-based interventions such as the Experience Corps volunteer program for older adults, nursing interventions such as an intervention to increase breastfeeding duration among low-income women, and medical interventions such as surgery for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. His burden of disease studies have focused on eye care and obesity. \u00a0He has published numerous international cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness studies or framework papers on eye care and related to nursing.","university_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1a/2b87ea33cdaa00d9f4b57372223284/bloomberg.small.horizontal.blue-Coursera.png","course-ids":[238,970460],"display":true,"recommended_background":"An understanding of issues related to the health impacts of obesity or\nsome basic microeconomics is helpful but not necessary."}
