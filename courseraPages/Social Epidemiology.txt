{"about_the_course":"This course is about understanding the determinants of health from a broad\nperspective. We focus on how social relationships and institutions -- such\nas familial relationships, national policies, and global economic forces\n-- promote or undermine the health of populations. The course covers existing\nevidence of health disparities, research methods, and theories relevant\nto the topic.\n<br>\n<br>The course is interesting because it reveals the so-called fundamental\ncauses of disease and health disparities recognizable within social groups.\nFor example, we examine why a flu germ can affect whole groups of people\ndifferently. In short, the course challenges the notion that health is\na narrowly defined medical problem.\n<br>\n<br>Students in the course will listen to lectures, read provided materials,\nand complete quizzes and tests that examine comprehension and one's ability\nto synthesize ideas.\n<br>\n<br><span>Upon completion of the course students should:<br></span>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>have a deep appreciation for how social arrangements impact the health\n        of populations,</li>\n    <li>be able to critically evaluate the scientific and popular health literature\n        that address the causes of disease,</li>\n    <li>be able to measure key social drivers such as race and socioeconomic status,\n        and&nbsp;</li>\n    <li>be able to conceive of research strategies that can answer questions critical\n        for policy making.</li>\n</ul>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/45/b72d293518f08ce1ac1dc7fc1ffad2/Final-Social-Epidemiology-.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e5/d83d65ee86e54f915a1b211cbe2d76/Final-Social-Epidemiology-.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/356a4ab3519b9b7bab0f1bc9c9813b/Final-Social-Epidemiology-.jpg","video":"rm8zQS3VbjQ","university-ids":["minnesota"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/rm8zQS3VbjQ/","id":380,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/32/051960873fd1cc2b6a315b80853ff2/minnesota.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UMNews","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f2/c0c3766390def44d6704f82d4d7955/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"UofMN","logo":"","background_color":"","id":50,"location_city":"Minneapolis","location_country":"US","location_lat":44.98333400000000000,"location":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","primary_color":"#7A0019","abbr_name":"Minnesota","website":"http://www.umn.edu/","description":"The University of Minnesota is among the largest public research universities in the country, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional students a multitude of opportunities for study and research.
