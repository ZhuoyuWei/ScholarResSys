{"about_the_course":"For centuries we have collectively marveled at plant diversity and form\u2014from\nCharles Darwin\u2019s early fascination with stems and flowers to Seymour Krelborn\u2019s\ndistorted doting in Little Shop of Horrors. This course intends to present\nan intriguing and scientifically valid look at how plants themselves experience\nthe world\u2014from the colors they see to the sensations they feel. Highlighting\nthe latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner\nlives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that\nwe have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize.\nWe\u2019ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor\nhas been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate\nthe music you\u2019ve been playing for them or if they\u2019re just deaf to the sounds\naround them. We\u2019ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they\nrelate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be\naware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes\nhistorical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant\nto all humans who seek their place in nature. This class has three main\ngoals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses\n(sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to\nbiological research and the scientific method. 3. To get the student to\nquestion life in general and what defines us as humans.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c6/a1124a1e711503e3c5bbd7f2dded09/Courses2.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d3/e2f2a24c37aa64a9e16ac38387301b/Courses2.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ce/518719e523f99ab19de9e49e6a832a/Courses2.jpg","video":"koeIq13aQxk","university-ids":["telaviv"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/koeIq13aQxk/","id":592,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/be/b3f150b5cbb7012d0642757941b88c/200x48.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"telavivuni1","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/be/47ef4e542b6cf91426d91b3325a4eb/image001.png","website_facebook":"tau.main","logo":"","background_color":"","id":110,"location_city":"Tel Aviv","location_country":"IL","location_lat":32.11062320000000000,"location":"Dr. George Wise 40, Tel Aviv, Israel","primary_color":"#125EAC","abbr_name":"TAU","website":"http://english.tau.ac.il/","description":"Tel Aviv University (TAU) - Israel's largest and most comprehensive institution of higher learning - is home to over 30,000 students studying in nine faculties and over 125 schools and departments across the spectrum of sciences, humanities and the arts.
