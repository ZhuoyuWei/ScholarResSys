{"about_the_course":"<span><p>In this 16-week course we\u2019ll introduce the fundamentals of computational arts\u2013covering basic programming, simple image processing and elementary sound recording. This class has been taught for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, and is an accessible introduction to combining arts and computing. </p><p>For programming we\u2019ll be using the free and open source programming language and integrated development environment, Processing. The course will provide the essentials of programming in a visual context, allowing you to visualize, design, and create generative art with Processing.</p><p>For visuals we\u2019ll cover Photoshop CS5 and GIMP, which is a free open-source tool offering the same functionality as Photoshop. Whether you have access to one or the other, you will learn how to create and manipulate digital images, and most importantly, you will become comfortable enough to expand on what you learn here, after the end of our course.</p><p>For sound we\u2019ll teach both Logic and Soundation. Logic is Apple\u2019s DAW or Digital Audio Workstation while Soundation is a free web-based multi-track audio editor. We\u2019ll be teaching the basics of digital audio\u2013including recording, and automating effects. </p><p>You will complete both technical assignments and artistic projects, and learn how to participate in an aesthetic critique. We\u2019ll cover the history of sound and art in the Twentieth and 21st Centuries to give context for your artistic endeavors.</p><p>Peer review is integral to the success of this class; we will also teach you how to give constructive criticism. By the end of the 15 weeks you should have a strong foundation for how computers work and deal with data, specifically how image and sound are represented by the computer.</p><p>Additionally, you\u2019ll create an online portfolio of digital art projects, and be able to communicate ideas about art. &nbsp;</p><p>Each week you\u2019ll watch two video series - one on the theory and one on the practice. There will be technical assignments and artistic projects which will be peer reviewed. We\u2019re looking forward to working with you. </p><div><br></div></span>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b7/b6e0e72268b561250e9068a642ae98/YSkFtIC---Imgur.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c7/d0829fbcef7025863577b989eb007e/YSkFtIC---Imgur.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fc/3a1fd7c9f092a0e1e04a1abb3c1626/YSkFtIC---Imgur.png","video":"","university-ids":["suny"],"video_baseurl":"","id":743,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"","logo":"","background_color":"","id":117,"location_city":"Albany","location_country":"US","location_lat":42.65257930000000000,"location":"Albany, NY","primary_color":"","abbr_name":"SUNY","website":"","description":"The State University of New York, with 64 unique institutions, is the largest comprehensive system of higher education in the United States.

Your work on the  assignments, projects and group presentation will be assessed two ways: your  individual work to complete the assignment, project or presentation, and your  own review of your peers\u2019 work. Peer review counts as the participation  component of your own grade, which means for everything you hand in you will  also make substantive comments on the assignments which will be graded, and  rate others\u2019 comments. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<span>\n  <span><span>\n    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Weight</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>Participation    Component</strong></p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p>Quizzes (12)</p>\n    <p>10 % </p>\n    <p>0 %</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p>Assignments (12)</p>\n    <p>20 %</p>\n    <p>20 %</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p>Project 1 (visual) </p>\n    <p>20 %</p>\n    <p>25 % </p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p>Project 2 (sound)</p>\n    <p>20 %</p>\n    <p>25 %</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p>Group Presentation (1)</p>\n    <p>5 %</p>\n    <p>50 % </p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p>Final Project<br>\n      (visual, sound, programming)</p>\n    <p>25 %</p>\n    <p>25 %</p>\n  </span>\n</span></span>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Quizzes </strong><br>\nAfter watching each video lecture series, you  will take a multiple choice quiz which will count towards your final grade. You  can only take these quizzes once. There are also \u201cin-video questions,\u201d and you  must answer these questions correctly in order to advance the video, but these  questions are NOT graded, you can re-do the \u201cin-video\u201d quiz as many times as  you need to. </p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Assignments</strong><br>\nAssignments are purely technical; each module  will include a detailed explanation of how to complete and grade each assignment.  There will be 1 assignment (which may have multiple components)&nbsp; every week that there is no project due.&nbsp; Each assignment should take you no more than  one hour.</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Projects</strong><br>\nProjects are both aesthetic and technical; there  will be an explanation of how to grade projects but you must remember that art  is subjective. There are only three projects, and together they are worth the  majority of your grade. You can expect these projects to take at&nbsp; least 3-4 hours to complete. (Final project  should take 6 hours.)</p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Group  Presentation</strong><br>\n  In groups of 4-7, you will create a five-minute  presentation that the other students can view. You can use any method or  technology for loading this that works with your eportfolio site and  collaborating. There will be a list of topics to choose from on a movement in  twentieth or 21st century art or music. </p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> \u201cThe course schedule, policies, procedures,  and assignments in this course are subject to change in the event of  extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement, and/or to ensure better student  learning.\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>COURSE SCHEDULE</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Week 01-04 </strong>Introduction to Computing  and Processing<br>\n    <strong>Week 05-09 </strong>Introduction to Digital Art  and Photoshop/Gimp<br>\n    <strong>Week 10-14:</strong> Introduction to Electronic  Music and Logic/Soundation<br>\n    <strong>Week 15: </strong>Putting it All Together:  Programming, Visuals and Sound</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<span>\n  <span><span>\n    <p><strong>Assignments    due:</strong></p>\n    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 1</strong></p>\n    <p>Install Programs</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 2</strong></p>\n    <p>Processing Assignment 1</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 3</strong></p>\n    <p>Processing Assignment 2</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 4</strong></p>\n    <p>Processing Assignment 3</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 5</strong></p>\n    <p>Image Assignment 1</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 6</strong></p>\n    <p>Image Assignment 2</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 7</strong></p>\n    <p>Image Assignment 3</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 8</strong></p>\n    <p>Image Assignment 4</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week 9</strong></p>\n    <p>Project 1 (Image)</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    10</strong></p>\n    <p>Sound Assignment 1</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    11</strong></p>\n    <p>Sound Assignment 2</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    12</strong></p>\n    <p>Sound Assignment 3</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    13</strong></p>\n    <p>Project 2 (Sound) </p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    14</strong></p>\n    <p>Portfolio Assignment 1</p>\n  </span>\n  <span>\n    <p><strong>Week    15</strong></p>\n    <p>Project 3 (Processing, Sound and Image) </p>\n  </span>\n</span></span>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Course  Questions - FAQ</strong><br>\n  Have a question about the content of the course?
