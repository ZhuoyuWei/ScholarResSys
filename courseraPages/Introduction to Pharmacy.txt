{"about_the_course":"<b></b>\n\n<p>Man has always used external materials to help prevent, cure, or alleviate\n    the symptoms of disease. In fact, Gregory Higby of the American Institute\n    of the History of Pharmacy has written\u00a0that, \u201c...the very concept\n    of influencing bodily functions via an outside force must be considered\n    one of humanity\u2019s greatest advances.\u201d Since its independent\u00a0origins\n    in ancient Arabic civilizations, pharmacy has evolved from a craft dedicated\n    to the compounding of drugs to a profession focusing on helping patients\n    get the best outcomes from medication therapies.</p>\n<p>So what is pharmacy? How has it changed and where is it headed?</p>\n<p>This course will answer these questions and provide a comprehensive introduction\n    to this profession. We will explore the history of pharmacy and its evolving\n    scope of practice; examine educational and career pathways; tackle issues\n    relating to medication safety and adverse drug events; gain insight into\n    the regulatory and ethical considerations in pharmacy practice; and more.</p>\n<p>As we explore these topics together, we will hear from practicing pharmacists\n    throughout the course and ultimately gain a better understanding of what\n    they do and how they help us get the best results from our medications.\n    Maybe you will decide that the dynamic profession of pharmacy is a career\n    path that you want to pursue! \u00a0Whether student or healthcare consumer,\n    you\u2019re sure to find the material we cover in this course to be invaluable.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3c/c1396b3b15c8fe6c7941aa6c2f961c/intro-pharm.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/78/c6efa8cac6a6f725c7ae9097e9c6bf/intro-pharm.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/27/08088f582e6ff1739181f5683a473c/intro-pharm.png","video":"hAc_1TeVoYQ","university-ids":["osu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/hAc_1TeVoYQ/","id":189,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"OhioState","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ae/1201e9f6249cafd6a532170780de3a/favicon-osu.png","website_facebook":"osu","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/fb97a1c3348fbf33a57859cc833585/preferred_red.png","background_color":"","id":28,"location_city":"Columbus","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.96117550000000000,"location":"Columbus, OH","primary_color":"#990000","abbr_name":"Ohio State","website":"http://www.osu.edu/","description":"The Ohio State University is one of the largest universities in the United States.
