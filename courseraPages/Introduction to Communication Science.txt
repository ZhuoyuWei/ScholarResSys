{"about_the_course":"<p>Since Antiquity,\nscholars have appreciated the importance of communication: as social beings, we\ncannot exist without communication. We need to interact with people around us,\nto make sense of the world and to position ourselves in a wider social and\ncultural reality. In this course, we look at how and why communication evolved\nas a science and reflect on today\u2019s dominant paradigms. The course also extends\nbeyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of\nhistory, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all\nover the world.</p>\n\nIntroduction to Communication Science explores some of the basic \ntheories, models and concepts from the fields of mass, interpersonal and\n intrapersonal communication. The course begins with a consideration of \nseveral basic models, subsequently progressing to the history of \ncommunication theory, linear effect-oriented theories, the reception \napproach and, finally, exploring theories on the production and \nreinforcement of culture through communication. <br>\n<br>\nUpon completion of this course, students should:<br>\n\u2022\thave a knowledge of the history and development of communication science; <br>\n\u2022\thave a knowledge of the dominant theoretical approaches within communication science; <br>\n\u2022\thave a knowledge and understanding of the most important models and concepts in this field. <br><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/74/b4c3a75149b177d8cfbcfba7de3b14/Laswell2.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/53326e08f6a1d23f1d343a3e25687e/Laswell2.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3a/331f032036d1ada24d02ec99a4903f/Laswell2.png","video":"aMpV5A7bpog","university-ids":["amsterdam"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/aMpV5A7bpog/","id":832,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UvA_Amsterdam","china_mirror":3,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"UniversityofAmsterdam","logo":"","background_color":"","id":131,"location_city":"Amsterdam","location_country":"NL","location_lat":52.37021570000000000,"location":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","primary_color":"","abbr_name":"UvA","website":"http://www.uva.nl/","description":"A modern university with a rich history, the University of Amsterdam\n(UvA) traces its roots back to 1632, when the Golden Age school Athenaeum\nIllustre was established to train students in trade and philosophy.
