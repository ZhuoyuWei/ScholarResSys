{"about_the_course":"<p>Growing old is discussed today in ominous terms \u2013 concerns about disease,\n    dysfunction, and destitution are daily discussed by media and policy makers.\n    What are individuals, families, communities and societies to make of an\n    ageing world? We analyze contemporary topics in psychological and social\n    ageing from a global perspective. Each week, we pose a question to be explored\n    and discussed online. Participants are encouraged to contribute their experiences\n    and perspectives as we create a global community to discuss age, ageing,\n    and the science of gerontology in action. Participants will then compile\n    a portfolio of materials they create and/or collect to address each week\u2019s\n    question and critically reflect their knowledge and experience throughout\n    the course. Portfolios are then reviewed by peers at the end of the course\n    to foster continued discourse among participants in our COURSERA community.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/41/0a3977d20447a8dd13dfa77ae1b95c/Kagan-Intro-fancy-back-16.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/53/36cef703d4a37e05a571326d4e7d98/Kagan-Intro-fancy-back-16.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e4/dab967e22d1600a37c14a4558eb802/Kagan-Intro-fancy-back-16.png","video":"ls5wfHfKO7Y","university-ids":["penn"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/ls5wfHfKO7Y/","id":371,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/14/c965e1f5cf9ead221ad770bd907f3a/Penn-logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"pennopencourses","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png","background_color":"","id":6,"location_city":"Philadelphia","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.95233500000000000,"location":"Philadelphia, PA","primary_color":"#0000FF","abbr_name":"Penn","website":"http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning","description":"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.
