{"about_the_course":"This course covers topics on the structure and reactivity of organic compounds with an emphasis on bioorganic chemistry and applications to life sciences. \u00a0Stereochemical concepts and aspects of non-covalent interactions relevant to enzyme-catalyzed reactions are presented. \u00a0The mechanistic approach of this course is designed to help students build intuition about how bioorganic compounds undergo their chemical transformations. The structure and reactivity of the major classes of bioorganic molecules - proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids - will be covered in detail. An introduction to biosynthesis will be presented, along with the use of contemporary literature and structural databases. Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on mechanism-based problem-solving skills to help students understand and think critically about the organic chemistry of living systems. This course, orgchem2b, and its prerequisite, orgchem2a, are equivalent to a second-semester organic chemistry course; these courses are well suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/orgchem2b/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/orgchem2b/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/orgchem2b/large-icon.png","video":"wHvjmTErsPo","university-ids":["illinois"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/wHvjmTErsPo/","id":143,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/6401c0ebc5e834eed7f5017d6d80fd/illinois-svg.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Illinois_Alma","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2b/57d79bc1eb5b081e6a1b3729782566/favicon.png","website_facebook":"illinois.edu","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/ff5237ed042c63a02e67e2094e97c1/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign.png","background_color":"","id":17,"location_city":"Cunningham","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.11058750000000000,"location":"Urbana, Illinois","primary_color":"#003C7D","abbr_name":"Illinois","website":"http://illinois.edu/","description":"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a world leader in research, teaching and public engagement, distinguished by the breadth of its programs, broad academic excellence, and internationally renowned faculty and alumni.

Webcasts of a related theme, along with a set of PDF lecture notes, constitute a\u00a0<strong>lesson</strong>. There are 20 lessons in the course. Students are expected to watch and study these materials independently, much as they would study a traditional textbook. We encourage students to comment with feedback or questions via the discussion board.\u00a0<br><br>Bundled with each lesson are problems designed to help students test their understanding of webcast material and apply their knowledge to new situations. All problems in the course are delivered to students electronically and machine graded with real-time feedback.\u00a0<strong>Problems of the Day</strong>\u00a0are covered by instructors during class time and emphasize the acquisition of skills, strategies, and attitudes for heuristic (non-algorithmic) problem solving.<strong>\u00a0Pressure Point Problems</strong>, or \"P3s,\" are more difficult, timed problems that help students prepare for exam situations. Because training effective problem solvers is one of our primary goals, we strongly emphasize tackling and understanding the problems associated with each lesson.\u00a0<br><br>Placing lecture contents online has allowed us to use class time almost exclusively to sharpen students' problem solving abilities. During\u00a0<strong>discussion sessions</strong>, students and instructors communicate online through web-based conferencing technology. Using this technology, we are able to run discussion sessions for large numbers of students while maintaining an interactive, engaging learning environment. In all discussion sessions, the emphasis is on student activity and participation.","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/orgchem2b/small-icon.hover.png","suggested_readings":"","instructor":"Jeffrey S.
