{"about_the_course":"<p>According\nto the OECD, the total global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for\ntransport, electricity generation, transmission and distribution, water and\ntelecommunications comes to $71tn. This figure represents about 3.5% of the\nannual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.</p><p>The\nEuropean Commission estimated that, by 2020, Europe will need between euro 1.5tn\nand euro 2tn of infrastructure investments. In the time period between 2011 and\n2020, about euro 500bn will be required for the implementation of the\nTrans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) programme, euro 400bn for Energy\ndistribution networks and smart grids, euro 200 bn on Energy transmission\nnetworks and storage and euro 500bn for the upgrade and construction of new\npower plants. An additional euro 38-58bn and euro 181-268bn capital investment\nwill be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband\ndiffusion.<br></p><p>Traditionally, investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. <br></p><p>The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoints of equity, debt and hybrid instruments. <br></p>\n\n<p>The course is concentrated on the practical aspects of project finance, the most frequently used financial technique for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies allows students to link the theoretical\nbackground to actual business practice.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, students will be in the position to analyze a\ncomplex transaction, to identify key elements of the deal and to suggest proper\nsolutions for deal structuring from the perspective of a financial advisor.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/59/d8db02b962d49aa0b5b4be8c6200da/Untitled.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cd/ee6874d468235082dc37d11fa7e93c/Untitled.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a4/44cfc5bbed508a0802a9323800c3dc/Untitled.png","video":"","university-ids":["bocconi"],"video_baseurl":"","id":1142,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"unibocconi","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/71/231ea361ee164974a4a2ab2105a2db/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"bocconi","logo":"","location_lat":45.46545420000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Milano","location_country":"IT","id":157,"location":"Milano, MI, Italia","primary_color":"#00468A","abbr_name":"Bocconi","website":"http://www.unibocconi.eu/","description":"Our ambition is to develop students' potential and foster knowledge in Business, Economics and Law through innovative learning and research activities in a multicultural environment.
