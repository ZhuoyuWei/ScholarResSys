{"about_the_course":"<p><span>Animals occupy a huge part of the planet and\nour lives, and although we rely on them for all aspects of our own wellbeing - food, draught power, medical advances, clothing, sport as well as pleasure,\nprotection and comfort - often their quality of life is questionable. Appreciating how animal's\u00a0experience the world they live in and\u00a0the different behavioural needs of the various species we\u00a0interact with,\u00a0enables us to gain a better\u00a0understanding of their welfare requirements, so that long term improvements to animal lives can be made.\u00a0\u00a0<br></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>There are now more than 60 billion\nland animals raised for meat <i>each year</i> around the world, and with\nincreasing human populations and a rise in meat consumption in many parts of the world, these figures are set to double by 2050. Added to this is a huge and growing\u00a0world population of dogs and cats, many of whom are strays\u00a0with associated health and welfare issues.\u00a0\u00a0International concern for animal welfare\ncontinues to grow with rising demand for measures to protect animals and\nimprove their care and wellbeing. The link between animal welfare and human\nwellbeing is clear, and yet we still have a long way to go if we are to address\nwelfare needs globally. Finding ways to </span>achieve higher standards of animal welfare, is therefore a key priority for any developed and developing nation. Due to gaining in importance internationally, there is increasing recognition of the need for animal welfare issues to be addressed objectively in a scientifically credible manner. <br></p><p>In this animal behaviour and welfare course, you will learn about animal welfare and why it matters, develop an understanding of some of the main welfare issues animals have to cope with as well as gaining an insight into the behavioural needs and the emotions\u00a0of dogs, cats, farmed animals and\n    captive wildlife.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n    <i>This course is delivered collaboratively by academics from the University of Edinb</i><i>ur</i><i>gh and Scotland's Rural College (SRUC).</i></p><p><i></i>\n    <img width=\"92\" height=\"95\" style=\"float: right;\" alt=\"The University of Edinburgh logo\" src=\"http://www.ecampbell.chem.ed.ac.uk/nanospec/images/edinburghcrest.bmp\">\n    <img width=\"104\" height=\"104\" style=\"float: right;\" alt=\"Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) logo\" src=\"https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/2658915897/aed4c0f12eda0f535c7a02a7d323141c.jpeg\">\n\n</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e0/b9a9af76525b66801e0e89826b8414/ABW-Dog.jpg.jpeg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/85/0d00aa299a19ec6d010865210e2757/ABW-Dog.jpg.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/71/6bdf8d2d06af05cf23323c73581dc5/ABW-Dog.jpg.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["edinburgh"],"video_baseurl":"","id":1158,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/6f0cac699523103808a9303765f54e/UoE-vector-side-align.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UniofEdinburgh","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d3/bcdd33b2d979d2bea9467b17f9bbbb/favicon-edinburgh.ico","website_facebook":"UniversityOfEdinburgh","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7f/781467d4f282293bb644ca68683509/UoE-Logo-200x48-Left-Centred-Text-Trans-v3.png","background_color":"","id":14,"location_city":"Edinburgh","location_country":"GB","location_lat":55.95325200000000000,"location":"Edinburgh, United Kingdom","primary_color":"#002675","abbr_name":"Edinburgh","website":"http://www.ed.ac.uk/","description":"Delivering excellence in teaching and learning. \n\nConsistently ranked as one of the world's top 50 universities and top 3 UK provider of online Masters courses.

We can use knowledge of animal physiology and both normal\nand abnormal behaviour as complementary approaches in the assessment of the\nwelfare of an animal in its captive environment. We can also employ\nexperimental techniques to try to understand animal emotions in relation to their living conditions, for example; to determine their preferences, or what they don't like or find aversive\u00a0about a \u00a0procedure or environment. These experimental techniques allow us to \u2018ask\u2019\nthe animals how they feel about their environment. In week 2 we will explore a\nvariety of techniques used practically and experimentally to provide an insight\ninto the animal\u2019s experience of its world. </p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Week\n3: Practical Animal Welfare: Companion Animal Welfare</p>\n\n<p>In\nmany countries dogs and cats are traditionally kept as pets in the home, with\nstray/abandoned or unwanted animals usually housed in shelters, where there are\nfrequently questions about their behavioural needs. In other parts of the world\ndogs and cats may exist very successfully as part of a \u2018community\u2019 or as\n\u2018street\u2019 animals, and this existence also presents unique challenges and\nbenefits to the welfare of these species. In this lecture we will explore the\nplace of dogs and cats in human society and how different attitudes and\nmanagement styles impact on their welfare.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Week\n4: Practical Animal Welfare: Production Animal Welfare</p>\n\n<p>Production animal welfare is a hot topic. In this\nsession you will gain an appreciation of the relevance of farm animal welfare\nand the issues that impact on production animal species.\u00a0 We shall also look at the way that scientists\nhave contributed to our understanding of the importance of these impacts from\nan animal's point of view. We will explore societal concerns, the scientific\nunderstanding of animal welfare within a variety of production methods and how\nwe gain insight to the animal's viewpoint.\u00a0\n</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Week\n5: Practical Animal Welfare: Captive Wild Animal Welfare</p>\n\n<p>During\nthe fifth week we will summarise key welfare issues relating to the management\nof captive wild animals in zoos. Primarily conservation-focussed, the zoo community is\nbecoming increasingly aware of the welfare concerns arising from the management\nof captive wild animals and is developing strategies to address these issues.\nWe will look at the conflicts between welfare and conservation, the methods for\nassessing welfare within a zoo environment and the challenges associated with\nthis.</p><p><br></p>","course_format":"","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/85/0d00aa299a19ec6d010865210e2757/ABW-Dog.jpg.jpg","suggested_readings":"<p>There are many books on Animal Behaviour and Welfare.
