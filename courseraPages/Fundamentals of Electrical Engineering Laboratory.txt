{"about_the_course":"This course represents a\u00a0<i>real</i> hands-on laboratory course in introductory electronics. In it, you will learn how to use the instruments every electrical engineer needs to know: the oscilloscope, function generator and multi-meter. You will use\nthese instruments running on your computer to measure voltages from circuits you will build from <b>actual</b> electrical components with measurement systems provided by National Instruments, Inc. Students will be required to purchase hardware, software\nand electrical parts.\n<br>\n<br>This laboratory uses the terminology and knowledge of electrical engineering provided in Coursera's\u00a0<i><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/eefun\" target=\"_blank\">Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering</a>.</i> You can take the laboratory simultaneously\nwith this course or afterwards. Once you learn the basics found in the laboratory course, you will know how to interface electrical circuits to measurement systems, be they analog or digital. You will have the knowledge to build live circuits and get\nthem to work. No simulations!!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>This lab would not be possible without the strong involvement of our industrial partners. National Instruments makes the myDAQ interface equipment as well as the LabView and ELVISMX software system that emulates measurement instruments. DigiKey Corporation\ngathered the diverse collection of electrical and electronics parts into a course-specific parts kit. Mathworks is supplying the Matlab software environment for this course without charge for the course's duration.\n<br>\n<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/eefunlab%2Fimages%2FLogos%2FCombined_Logo.png\" title=\"Image: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/eefunlab%2Fimages%2FLogos%2FCombined_Logo.png\">\n<br><br>ORDERING YOUR KIT\n<br>Details are being worked out!","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/cd/94eac89b1fda9bbbc5912e662ca3d4/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/2a/a86fa5e4143f186c1c8916377ea098/large-icon.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/47/a9ab3527b0a13d408f8229f1e35949/large-icon.png","video":"","university-ids":["rice"],"video_baseurl":"","id":736,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cd/b85201c78e6ec548eb11caee9176a4/Rice_Logo_vectornr_cousera.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"riceuniversity","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/17ce4ffdaddcc4aab941da137ddbbf/favicon-rice.ico","website_facebook":"RiceUniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7d/4947c91627863bac0e4f303efb02cb/logo-rice-front.png","background_color":"#242d64","id":13,"location_city":"Houston","location_country":"US","location_lat":29.76019270000000000,"location":"Houston, TX","primary_color":"#242D64","abbr_name":"Rice","website":"http://rice.edu/","description":"Located on a 300-acre forested campus in Houston, Rice University is consistently ranked among the top 20 universities in the U.S. and the top 100 in the world.

The software that emulates the measurement instruments does need computing power. Our testing suggests that modern laptops can easily support the required computational load but not tablet computers.
