{"about_the_course":"This course introduces the cornerstones of functional programming using the Scala programming language. Functional programming has become more and more popular in recent years because it promotes code that\u2019s safe, concise, and elegant. Furthermore, functional programming makes it easier to write parallel code for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s multiprocessors by replacing mutable variables and loops with powerful ways to define and compose functions. <br><br> Scala is a language that fuses functional and object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates seamlessly with Java and its tools. Scala is now used in a rapidly increasing number of open source projects and companies. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Tumblr, and Klout. <br><br> In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically. <br><br> The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them, modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series of assignments, most of which are also programming projects.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/progfun/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/progfun/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/progfun/large-icon.png","video":"_NVySmdAH4c","university-ids":["epfl"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/_NVySmdAH4c/","id":116,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/89/7f14b8c6f54b56a2446c99b2b8df86/EPFL_LOG_QUADRI_Red_resized.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"EPFL","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/142188830b51c8c51b95cc25e5dbf3/epflfav.png","website_facebook":"EPFL.ch","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/0a73c737b332745aac47797f57cda4/logo-epfl-front.png","background_color":"","id":16,"location_city":"Lausanne","location_country":"CH","location_lat":46.51996170000000000,"location":"Lausanne, Switzerland","primary_color":"#7E000C","abbr_name":"EPFL","website":"http://www.epfl.ch/","description":"","short_name":"epfl","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/22/b50d471bc34471c5a7c696b1d714cc/rolex_learning_center.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"user/epflnews","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ab/bb616e071f67f5bcaead9b67dbaa36/banner-epfl.jpg","location_state":"VD","name":"\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/01/a5c9c211331132096e7ba9942dbd51/square_epfl_400.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5f/f441e9c1630625018763c3b86cf582/square_epfl_400.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a7/fca9be507583b1f25e0fcd9fca0d59/square_epfl_400.svg","location_lng":6.63359709999997450,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Learn about functional programming, and how it can be effectively combined with object-oriented programming.

He has been working on programming languages for most of his career. He first studied structured and object-oriented programming as a PhD student of Niklaus Wirth, then fell in love with functional programming while working as a post doc at IBM and Yale. When Java came out, he started to add functional programming constructs to the new platform. This led to Pizza and GJ and eventually to Java 5 with generics. During that time he also developed javac, the current reference compiler for Java. <br><br> Over the last 10 years, Martin worked on unifying object-oriented and functional programming in the Scala language. Scala quickly escaped from the research lab and became a popular open source tool and industrial language. He now oversees development of Scala as head of the programming group at EPFL and as chairman of the Typesafe company.","university_logo":"","course-ids":[308,970457,971423],"display":true,"recommended_background":"<div>You should have at least one year programming experience.
