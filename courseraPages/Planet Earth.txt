{"about_the_course":"Earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, ice ages, landslides, floods, life evolution, plate motions\u2014all of these phenomena have interacted over the vast expanses of deep time to sculpt the dynamic planet that we live on today. \u00a0Planet Earth presents an overview of our home, from a geological perspective. \u00a0We learn how the elements comprising the Earth formed in the guts of stars and supernovae, how Earth and its Solar System neighbors formed from a vast cloud of gas and dust over 4.5 billion years ago. \u00a0And how the atmosphere, oceans, and rocks of our planet form and change. \u00a0We will emphasize how plate tectonics\u2014the grand unifying theory of geology\u2014explains how the map of our planet's surface has changed radically over geologic time, and why as present-day geologic activity\u2014including a variety of devastating natural disasters\u2014occur where they do. \u00a0We will also discuss the fascinating interactions and exchanges that take place among land, sea, air, and life, and how these interactions they result in the great variety of landscapes\u2014from deserts to glaciers\u2014that make our planet unique, and influence climate change in the past and, potentially the future. \u00a0Finally, we will delve into the processes that produce the energy and mineral resources that modern society depends on, to help understand the context of the environment and sustainability challenges that we will face in the future.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/earth/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/earth/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/earth/large-icon.png","video":"D25XsQMyt6U","university-ids":["illinois"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/D25XsQMyt6U/","id":137,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/6401c0ebc5e834eed7f5017d6d80fd/illinois-svg.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Illinois_Alma","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2b/57d79bc1eb5b081e6a1b3729782566/favicon.png","website_facebook":"illinois.edu","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/ff5237ed042c63a02e67e2094e97c1/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign.png","background_color":"","id":17,"location_city":"Cunningham","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.11058750000000000,"location":"Urbana, Illinois","primary_color":"#003C7D","abbr_name":"Illinois","website":"http://illinois.edu/","description":"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a world leader in research, teaching and public engagement, distinguished by the breadth of its programs, broad academic excellence, and internationally renowned faculty and alumni.
