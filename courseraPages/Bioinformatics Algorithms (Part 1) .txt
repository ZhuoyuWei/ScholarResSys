{"about_the_course":"<p><span class=\"GingerNoCheckStart\"></span>The sequencing of the&nbsp;human genome a decade ago&nbsp;fueled a computational revolution\n    in biology, which&nbsp;has arguably been an impetus for more new&nbsp;algorithms\n    than any other fundamental realm of&nbsp;science.&nbsp; The newly formed&nbsp;links\n    between computer science and biology affect the way we teach computational\n    ideas to biologists, as well as how applied algorithms are taught to computer\n    scientists.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Genome sequencing is just one of hundreds of biological problems that\n    have become inextricable from the computational methods required to solve\n    them. In this course, we will take a look at some of the algorithmic ideas\n    that are&nbsp;fundamental to an&nbsp;understanding of modern biology.&nbsp;\n    Computational concepts like dynamic programming and graph theory&nbsp;will\n    help us explore algorithms applied to&nbsp;a wide range of biological topics,\n    from finding regulatory motifs&nbsp;to reconstructing the tree of life.&nbsp; Throughout\n    the process, we will apply&nbsp;<i>real</i> bioinformatics algorithms to&nbsp;<i>real</i> genetic\n    data.</p>\n<p>We have created an interactive textbook for this course, which allows you to learn and solve problems concurrently. &nbsp;This textbook will be hosted on <a href=\"https://beta.stepic.org/2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://beta.stepic.org/2\">Stepic</a>,&nbsp;a new resource for learning interactively.</p><span class=\"GingerNoCheckEnd\"></span>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/92/8a7b48f5f44562168d72ecc5b472f6/Bioinf.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/58/fc2352270af701c467c03792e93a5b/Bioinf.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c7/be0dd407562e5c562e97a0f3b79a6e/Bioinf.png","video":"t5t_nfzdzEg","university-ids":["ucsd"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/t5t_nfzdzEg/","id":471,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/71/2c1c6e2435aa3ca018494c47b0e12d/UC-San-Diego-blue--gold.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"ucsandiego","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"UCSanDiego","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/f1bbcb4068ae9b1d93a066a39c2af3/UCSanDiego-Coursera-wide.png","background_color":"","id":53,"location_city":"San Diego","location_country":"US","location_lat":32.84722000000000000,"location":"La Jolla, San Diego, CA","primary_color":"#016691","abbr_name":"UC San Diego","website":"http://ucsd.edu/","description":"UC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.
