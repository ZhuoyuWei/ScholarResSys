Whatever your path, my goal is that this class can\n    give you the information and space you need to improve your public speaking\n    skills. Here are some of the course assignments and activities:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Video lectures</strong>: Most of the course content is delivered\n        through a number of video lectures. Each video runs 10-12 minutes and teaches\n        a specific public speaking ability or concept.\n        <br>\n        <br>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Discussion forums</strong>: This class thrives on discussion.\n        There are a number of discussion forums that emerge from the lectures and\n        sample speeches. You will have the ability to articulate your views on\n        public speaking as well as learn from your peers.\n        <br>\n        <br>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Quizzes</strong>: Many video lectures have short quizzes embedded\n        that reinforce basic knowledge of certain concepts and argument structures.\n        <br>\n        <br>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Google hangouts</strong>: Throughout the course, a few Google\n        hangouts will be hosted for chatting with selected students about their\n        experiences and challenges with speech composition and performance.\n        <br>\n        <br>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Speech Analysis and Modeling</strong>: One of the best ways to\n        refine your own speech ability is through a close study of others' speeches.&nbsp;\n        We will have a number of opportunities to examine and discuss sample speeches\n        and speakers. Growing out of our analysis of speakers, we will discuss\n        who you hold up as a model speaker and analyze what makes that speaker\n        so good.\n        <br>\n        <br>\n    </li>\n    <li><strong>Peer Assessment Assignments - Speeches and speech outlines</strong>:\n        There are three optional speech assignments: an impromptu, informative,\n        and persuasive speech.
