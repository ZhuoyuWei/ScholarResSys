{"about_the_course":"Chemical\nreactions underpin the production of pretty much everything in our modern\nworld.\u00a0 But, what is the driving force\nbehind reactions?\u00a0 Why do some reactions\noccur over geological time scales whilst others are so fast that we need\nfemtosecond-pulsed lasers to study them?\u00a0\nUltimately, what is going on at the atomic level?\u00a0 Discover the answers to such\nfundamental questions and more on this course in introductory physical chemistry.\u00a0\u00a0<br><br>The\ncourse covers the key concepts of three of the principal topics in first-year\nundergraduate physical chemistry: thermodynamics, kinetics and quantum\nmechanics. These three topics cover whether or not reactions occur, how fast\nthey go and what is actually going on at the\u00a0sub-atomic scale.<br><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/63/6034e2bcadd6c166a0697a0d63141a/graphene.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bd/b0564af15ed825c174f7ac5cbf62a9/graphene.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0d/90ee2f32c74ab9ceb378d51180add1/graphene.png","video":"D8esrAzCbWI","university-ids":["manchester"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/D8esrAzCbWI/","id":900,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"AdmissionsUoM","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/9d/5244ef42338d893472c33dac75833c/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"AdmissionsUoM","logo":"","location_lat":53.47932400000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Manchester","location_country":"GB","id":147,"location":"Manchester, United Kingdom","primary_color":"#660099","abbr_name":"Manchester","website":"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/","description":"Tracing its roots back to 1824, the University of Manchester is home to almost 40,000 students.
