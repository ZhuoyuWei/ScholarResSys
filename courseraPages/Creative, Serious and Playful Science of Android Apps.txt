{"about_the_course":"<b></b>Note: The December 2013 offering of this course is 8 weeks of instruction with a 3-week break in the middle, for a total of 11 weeks.<br><br>This course is a novice-friendly and delightful introduction to computer science and programming Android-apps for smart-phones and tablets. No prior programming knowledge is necessary. In this course you'll have fun learning to create an app for modern Android devices such as the Nexus tablet. <br><br>You'll use the programming tools that Android software developers use and build a complete and useful app during this course. Along the way, we'll introduce fundamental computer science principles and programming ideas that power today\u2019s smart-phone and tablet apps. <br><br>A reasonably modern and powerful Linux, Windows or Mac-OSX computer is required. A modern Android tablet or phone (such as the approximately USD$199 Nexus 7) \u00a0is useful but not-required because you\u2019ll be able to use a virtual device that runs on your computer.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/androidapps101/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/androidapps101/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/androidapps101/large-icon.png","video":"6rTbNJsztUU","university-ids":["illinois"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/6rTbNJsztUU/","id":131,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/6401c0ebc5e834eed7f5017d6d80fd/illinois-svg.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Illinois_Alma","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2b/57d79bc1eb5b081e6a1b3729782566/favicon.png","website_facebook":"illinois.edu","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/ff5237ed042c63a02e67e2094e97c1/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign.png","background_color":"","id":17,"location_city":"Cunningham","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.11058750000000000,"location":"Urbana, Illinois","primary_color":"#003C7D","abbr_name":"Illinois","website":"http://illinois.edu/","description":"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a world leader in research, teaching and public engagement, distinguished by the breadth of its programs, broad academic excellence, and internationally renowned faculty and alumni.
