{"about_the_course":"<b></b>In this\ncourse we shall examine how the idea of \"the modern\" develops at the\nend of the 18th century in European intellectual history, and how being modern (or progressive, or hip) became\none of the crucial criteria for understanding and evaluating cultural change\nduring the last two hundred years in the West. We shall be concerned with the relations\nbetween culture and historical change, and our materials shall be drawn from a\nvariety of areas: philosophy, the novel, and critical theory. Finally, we shall try to\ndetermine what it means to be modern today, and whether it makes sense to go\nbeyond the modern to the postmodern.\n\n\n\n<p><i>The Modern and the Postmodern</i> traces the intertwining of the\nidea of modernity with the idea of art or culture from the late 18th\ncentury until the present. Beginning with the Enlightenment, Western cultures\nhave invested heavily in the notion that the world can be made more of a home\nfor human beings through the development of culture (and technology).\nThroughout this period there has also developed a strong, sophisticated\ncounter-movement that sees the Enlightenment effort as a disaster \u2013 destructive\nof both art and of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nWestern idea of modernity is linked to but not the same as the idea of\nmodernism. We will examine both in this class and then consider postmodernism\nin relation both to the philosophical idea of modernity and to the aesthetic\nconsiderations of modernism.</p>\n\n\n\nThis course covers a lot of ground,\nhistorically, conceptually and aesthetically. There is much to read, and very\ndifferent kinds of reading: from philosophy to novels, from theory to poetry.\nNot all students will like all the reading, but if you digest it all, you\nshould have a clearer sense of the cultural history of our present. \n\n\n\n<br><br>Students\nshould develop a historical, literary and philosophical understanding of some\nof the key themes of modernity and modernism in the West. They should learn to\nread classic and contemporary texts for their arguments, beauty and pertinence.\nThey should see why these texts are \u201cgood to think with,\u201d and, it is hoped,\nthey will develop an appetite for further study in the areas covered by the\ncourse.\n<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ae/40ab4d371617977d0c8b273d63e014/The-Bar-at-the-Folies-Bergeres-by-Edouard-Manet.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/40/e01a7194c35f414f37235a1a4a96e9/The-Bar-at-the-Folies-Bergeres-by-Edouard-Manet.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e5/cdbf24bfcaacee34eac286619c822b/The-Bar-at-the-Folies-Bergeres-by-Edouard-Manet.jpg","video":"yA8mAeMib3s","university-ids":["wesleyan"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/yA8mAeMib3s/","id":177,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/81/eb4581c83f14140261faef71d3cb87/WESLEYAN_widelogo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"wesleyan_u","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/3d1139223689f57de761dd6783d8c3/6-wesleyan_small_icon.gif","website_facebook":"wesleyan.university","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/00d8a35e2324a3a5448474f800cbc4/1-wesleyan_logo.gif","background_color":"","id":34,"location_city":"Middletown","location_country":"US","location_lat":41.56232090000000000,"location":"Middletown, CT, United States","primary_color":"#990000","abbr_name":"Wesleyan","website":"http://www.wesleyan.edu/","description":"Wesleyan University is known for the excellence of its academic and co-curricular programs.
