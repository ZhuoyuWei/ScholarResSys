{"about_the_course":"<p>Since 2009 there has been a renewed wave of\npopular unrest sweeping throughout much of the Muslim world. Secular, but\ngenerally repressive and inefficient autocracies have come under pressure or\nbeen swept aside entirely. At the same, the various Islamic Republics have not\nfared much better, but been convulsed by internal unrest, economic and social\ndecline. Throughout the Muslim lands, existing constitutional arrangements are\nbeing challenged, often very violently. </p>\n\n<p><span>This course is a survey of the\nconstitutional ideas and institutions that have developed since the mid 19th\ncentury throughout predominantly Muslim countries, but its focus will lie on\nthe <i>actors</i> that have dominated this\ndiscourse and shaped its outcomes. We will look at the large body of classical\nwritings on the Islamic state only in so far as it is necessary to understand\nthe contemporary debate, but concentrate on the legal and political\ndevelopments of the 20th and 21st centuries.</span></p><p></p><p>Three common themes will characterise the course:\u00a0</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>We privilege the study of the <i>legal and social reality</i> and seek to highlight where it is at odds with dogmatic stipulations, be they religious or constitutional.\u00a0</li></ul><p></p><p></p><ul><li>We seek to illustrate the <i>practical tensions</i> posed by limited administrative capabilities and political legitimacy that resulted from the incomplete reception of modern bureaucratic statehood.\u00a0</li></ul><p></p><p></p><ul><li>We seek to examine how <i>popular dissatisfaction</i> with the practical performance of Muslim governments has fuelled demands for greater accountability under the guise of cultural authenticity.\u00a0</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the course aims to equip participants to better understand Muslim contemporary discourse about the <i>res publica</i>, better contextualise the demands for religious law in public life, and to better ascertain the theoretical and practical feasibility of postulated religious alternatives to the still-dominant secular model of governance.</p><p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/66/9d5e308eb020f72db558021530c4d6/muslim_democracy.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/3e/22a29f09a881794a9ac7fa82451aaf/muslim_democracy.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/45/ae92b8fc5d4629a785785e01599a9d/muslim_democracy.jpg","video":"g98W4LfC024","university-ids":["ucph"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/g98W4LfC024/","id":398,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"uni_copenhagen","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/55/45a9eafa2bfdb29d961f8472a0b7fa/favicon_fa.ico","website_facebook":"universitet","logo":"","background_color":"","id":63,"location_city":"kbh","location_country":"DK","location_lat":55.67609680000000000,"location":"Copenhagen, Denmark","primary_color":"#901A1E","abbr_name":"UCPH","website":"http://www.ku.dk/english","description":"The University of Copenhagen is the oldest University in Denmark - founded in 1479, and with over 38,000 students and more than 9,000 employees.
