{"about_the_course":"In this course, you will learn how to design technologies that bring people\njoy, rather than frustration. You'll learn several techniques for rapidly\nprototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives -- and why rapid\nprototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interaction\ndesign. You'll learn how to conduct fieldwork with people to help you get\ndesign ideas. How to make paper prototypes and low-fidelity mock-ups that\nare interactive -- and how to use these designs to get feedback from other\nstakeholders like your teammates, clients, and users. You'll learn principles\nof visual design so that you can effectively organize and present information\nwith your interfaces. You'll learn principles of perception and cognition\nthat inform effective interaction design. And you'll learn how to perform\nand analyze controlled experiments online. In many cases, we'll use Web\ndesign as the anchoring domain. A lot of the examples will come from the\nWeb, and we'll talk just a bit about Web technologies in particular. When\nwe do so, it will be to support the main goal of this course, which is\nhelping you build human-centered design skills, so that you have the principles\nand methods to create excellent interfaces with any technology.","subtitle_languages_csv":"tr,ja","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/hci/large-icon.png","preview_link":"https://class.coursera.org/hci-004/lecture/preview","small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/hci/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/hci/large-icon.png","video":"aAXS9sMJDF8","university-ids":["ucsd"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/aAXS9sMJDF8/","id":6,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/71/2c1c6e2435aa3ca018494c47b0e12d/UC-San-Diego-blue--gold.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"ucsandiego","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"UCSanDiego","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/f1bbcb4068ae9b1d93a066a39c2af3/UCSanDiego-Coursera-wide.png","background_color":"","id":53,"location_city":"San Diego","location_country":"US","location_lat":32.84722000000000000,"location":"La Jolla, San Diego, CA","primary_color":"#016691","abbr_name":"UC San Diego","website":"http://ucsd.edu/","description":"UC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.

Some of these may\n            contain integrated quiz questions. There will also be standalone quizzes\n            that are not part of video lectures.
