{"about_the_course":"What happens in the body when a person smokes a cigarette? After several weeks of smoking? When a person takes antidepressant or antipsychotic medication? A drug for pain, migraine, or epilepsy? A recreational drug? Neuroscientists are beginning to understand these processes. You\u2019ll learn how drugs enter the brain, how they act on receptors and ion channels, and how \u201cmolecular relay races\u201d lead to changes in nerve cells and neural circuits that far outlast the drugs themselves. \u201cDrugs and the Brain\u201d also describes how scientists are gathering the knowledge required for the next steps in preventing or alleviating Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, schizophrenia, and drug abuse.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/drugsandbrain/large-icon.png","preview_link":"https://class.coursera.org/drugsandbrain-002/lecture/preview","small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/drugsandbrain/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/drugsandbrain/large-icon.png","video":"","university-ids":["caltech"],"video_baseurl":"","id":83,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"caltech","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1c/237c842c020ea0a3a6c9647d5cbd66/favicon-caltech.ico","website_facebook":"californiainstituteoftechnology","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1f/ae499b8bc31f3f297a044e6e7dbf22/wordmarl_160x60_Trans.png","background_color":"","id":12,"location_city":"Pasadena","location_country":"US","location_lat":34.14778490000000000,"location":"Pasadena, CA, USA","primary_color":"#ED682B","abbr_name":"Caltech","website":"http://caltech.edu/","description":"The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is a world-renowned science and engineering research and education institution, where extraordinary faculty and students seek answers to complex questions, discover new knowledge, lead innovation, and transform our future.

Lester, Ph. D., is Bren Professor and Executive Officer for Neuroscience at the California Institute of Technology, where he has spent his entire teaching career. He has written almost 300 scientific papers and holds seven patents on drugs and the brain, including topics such as nicotine addiction and Parkinson\u2019s disease. He served as President of the Biophysical Society and as a member of the Advisory Council of the U. S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). He has conducted research sponsored by the California Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, the McKnight Endowment for Neuroscience, NIMH, and the National Institutes of Drug Abuse, Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Aging, Heart and Lung, and General Medical Science. He received the Fuller Award in Neuropharmacology from the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, the Cole Award in Membranes from the Biophysical Society, and two NINDS Jacob K. Javits Awards. He received degrees from Harvard and Rockefeller Universities.","university_logo":"","course-ids":[410,971466],"display":true,"recommended_background":"Neuroscience, the most interdisciplinary science of the 21st century, receives inputs from many other fields of science, medicine, clinical practice, and technology.\u00a0Previous exposure to one or more of the\u00a0subjects\u00a0listed in \"Suggested Readings\"\u00a0will provide a good vantage point,\u00a0as we introduce material from\u00a0these subjects."}
