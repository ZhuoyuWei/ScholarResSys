{"about_the_course":"<div>This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing\n    background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.\n    &nbsp;Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer\n    language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera.\n    To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming\n    environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple.\n    &nbsp;These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical\n    and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.\n    <br>\n    <br>The primary method for learning the course material will be to work through\n    multiple \"mini-projects\" in Python. &nbsp;To make this class enjoyable,\n    these projects will include building fun games such as Pong, Blackjack,\n    and Asteroids. &nbsp;When you\u2019ve finished our course, we can\u2019t promise\n    that you will be a professional programmer, but we think that you will\n    learn a lot about programming in Python and have fun while you\u2019re doing\n    it.</div>","subtitle_languages_csv":"zh","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/interactivepython/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/interactivepython/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/interactivepython/large-icon.png","video":"LjCzaz1aEBo","university-ids":["rice"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/LjCzaz1aEBo/","id":88,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cd/b85201c78e6ec548eb11caee9176a4/Rice_Logo_vectornr_cousera.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"riceuniversity","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/17ce4ffdaddcc4aab941da137ddbbf/favicon-rice.ico","website_facebook":"RiceUniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7d/4947c91627863bac0e4f303efb02cb/logo-rice-front.png","background_color":"#242d64","id":13,"location_city":"Houston","location_country":"US","location_lat":29.76019270000000000,"location":"Houston, TX","primary_color":"#242D64","abbr_name":"Rice","website":"http://rice.edu/","description":"Located on a 300-acre forested campus in Houston, Rice University is consistently ranked among the top 20 universities in the U.S. and the top 100 in the world.
