{"about_the_course":"<p>The language of health care providers at U.S. clinical sites is heavily infused with abbreviations and technical terms. Frequently, there is little time to ask for explanations. This course focuses on terms and abbreviations that will be heard or seen\n    during early clinical work. Terms are presented according to the clinical context in which they will be experienced using print, audio and visual representations. A web-based clinical dictionary for beginners provides additional information about\n    terms presented in the course as well as definitions of many important terms that could not be covered in the six week course.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/45/2edd6df91e4f29d01650d815e0f2f6/MP900433088.JPG","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/af/07603c92e620bc12654f68844d0ae5/MP900433088.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/73/74dc188fa6f388c28b67e74362ce0f/MP900433088.jpg","video":"MuFuPFNfA7w","university-ids":["pitt"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/MuFuPFNfA7w/","id":164,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"PittTweet","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/00/ee7a228aa46a231152d55b9bb9d0ae/logo_16x16.png","website_facebook":"UPitt","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/79/17cec4653cf480709f1e1387174c10/course_logo_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":36,"location_city":"Pittsburgh","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.44062479999999000,"location":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","primary_color":"#211C51","abbr_name":"Pittsburgh","website":"http://www.pitt.edu/","description":"Leader in Education | Pioneer in Research | Partner in Regional Development","short_name":"pitt","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/9f0fef78e7139d3b7b13241df58529/banner-edit.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"pittweb","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/b4/a20a6bc0497aff000b698a477aebba/banner_928x220.jpg","location_state":"PA","name":"University of Pittsburgh","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ec/05df639c8e1a3ff7617e1997f0feae/pittseal360x360-edit.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e7/eaadeaf0338f3f65156f819507e423/pittseal360x360-edit.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-79.99588640000002000,"home_link":"","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7b/10384469bc3891766ffd0ab7eb40b4/wide-logo.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Understanding the clinical terms and abbreviations commonly used in U.S. hospitals is challenging.

However, clinical settings in U.S. hospitals are often very busy, noisy places with people hurrying about to meet patients\u2019 needs. There will be little time for explanation of\n        the meanings of words. The more emergent the situation, the more likely that abbreviations will be used.
