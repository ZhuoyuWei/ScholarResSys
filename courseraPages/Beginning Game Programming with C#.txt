{"about_the_course":"<p>The Beginning Game\nProgramming with C# course is all about learning how to develop video games\nusing the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++, Java,\nActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First,\nusing C# lets us use the Microsoft XNA and open-source MonoGame frameworks,\nwhich help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS, and\nothers. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game\ndevelopers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity\nenvironment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to\nprogram.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That learning how to program\ncomment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming\nexperience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the\nvery beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the\nend of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts\nthat apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also\nlearn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the\nentities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and\nsimple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\nComputer programming is really fun in general,\nand programming games is even better!<br><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f4/fc7a006d2bafe837b6de5016d8a423/Course-Logo.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/4e/1d7362a932b2aa5baaa895d4f8425b/Course-Logo.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f0/377e1431e27761059cf1d408e67642/Course-Logo.png","video":"Bc1-PZ5NfRs","university-ids":["cusystem"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/Bc1-PZ5NfRs/","id":781,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"","logo":"","background_color":"","id":126,"location_city":"Denver","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.73756700000000000,"location":"Denver, CO","primary_color":"","abbr_name":"CU System","website":"","description":"The University of Colorado is a recognized leader in higher education on the national and global stage.
