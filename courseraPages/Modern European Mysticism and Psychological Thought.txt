{"about_the_course":"<p></p><p>In the revival of mysticism today, mysticism has\nbecome more psychological while psychology is increasingly interested in\nmysticism. This course will provide an entry into the complex world of modern\nmysticism, through studying its psychological thought. We shall begin with\nexploring the interpretations of mystical experience offered by psychoanalysts\nin the twentieth century, starting with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung and ending\nwith contemporary thinkers such as James Hillman. However, we will see that the\nEuropean mystical traditions, including Kabbalah in the Jewish world and those\nof the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant worlds, developed their own elaborate systems of\npsychological thought. Thus, we will mostly examine mystical psychology on its\nown terms. We shall especially look at two terms that are very much in use also\nin general culture: the heart (as an emotional rather than a physical center!...)\nand the soul, looking at the unique mystical concepts of their nature and destiny\nand asking if there were influences and meetings between the different\nreligions.\u00a0</p><p><br></p><p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f0/ca11f155e125282c51413211796d9d/ThinkLogo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/58/e29cfad54ad288ec6c8898f29ea694/ThinkLogo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/19/eb4e2328e003742b4091e6161f8e1d/ThinkLogo.jpg","video":"74jvjmzKNSQ","university-ids":["huji"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/74jvjmzKNSQ/","id":196,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/75/bb0ffb201ed83c70c82ee322b05af0/logo-uni.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"HebrewU_heb","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/48/7cac159746dca5674234142a147d0f/HebrewSmallIcon2.png","website_facebook":"thehebrewuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/cc2204d8828b8160b075451990c655/160-60-coursera.png","location_lat":31.79443100000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Jerusalem","location_country":"","id":24,"location":"Sderot Shayeret Har HaTsofim, Jerusalem","primary_color":"#C12127","abbr_name":"Hebrew University","website":"http://new.huji.ac.il/en","description":"Ranked among the top academic and research institutions worldwide, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is Israel's leading university and premier research institution.

Lectures are divided into several 5-15 minute segments. Occasionally there will be in-class learning reinforcement exercises (These will not be calculated into the final grade of the course).</p><p>Each lecture will be followed by a homework assignment which will consist of several questions. The answers will be peer-graded by other students in the course; from our experience, this method is one of the best ways to ensure that students think about and \"internalize\" - not just memorize - the material they have learnt. The final grade of the course will be the average of the student's six highest grades (out of seven) on the homework assignments.</p><p>In this course there is no required reading.
