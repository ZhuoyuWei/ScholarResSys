{"about_the_course":"<p>This course is designed to teach important concepts related to research data planning, collection, storage and dissemination. Instructors will offer information and best-practice guidelines for 1) investigator-initiated & sponsored research studies, 2) single- & multi-center studies, and 3) prospective data collection & secondary-reuse of clinical data for purposes of research. The curriculum will balance theoretical guidelines with the use of practical tools designed to assist in planning and conducting research. Real-world research examples, problem solving exercises and hands-on training will ensure students are comfortable with all concepts. \u00a0</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ce/6c32f8720ec9c8cd3dac99fcc1c83b/data-sm.jpeg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/26/75eec287db254ae99745688463e452/data-sm.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/68/4bd7bd90bd0c84612df8a586fa1ff3/data-sm.jpg","video":"HWcUCo5eZ6M","university-ids":["vanderbilt"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/HWcUCo5eZ6M/","id":242,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5f/efe6c18424e8b389d27cf695278a01/Certificate-WideLogo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"vanderbiltu","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/76/5bf77c95f3afdcd6ff0c88fbf95693/vanderbilt_16x16_b.png","website_facebook":"vanderbilt","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d2/12379e6f5878e9a8e8df310afe7e26/vanderbilt_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":37,"location_city":"Nashville","location_country":"US","location_lat":36.16666670000000000,"location":"Nashville, TN, USA","primary_color":"#5A0F3B","abbr_name":"Vanderbilt","website":"http://www.vanderbilt.edu/","description":"Vanderbilt University, located in Nashville, Tenn., is a private research university and medical center offering a full-range of undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees.","short_name":"vanderbilt","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2f/42ef92a0781fdae4b1e6bd739d054f/Vanderbilt-Coursera-1280x320.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"vanderbilt","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d6/14e4aacad098aa3b2e2b3cda3112d1/vanderbilt_928x220.jpg","location_state":"TN","name":"Vanderbilt University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8f/64ec0b2f7b95b23b7e5f0537131e9c/Vanderbilt-Coursera-360x360.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/77/a41dee6237efd36fc2d22a7536acbe/Vanderbilt-Coursera-360x360.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/95/017818e00392a394c55112d2a726b4/Vanderbilt-Coursera.svg","location_lng":-86.78333329999998000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/89ec947a4081dd88dcea207ad21a59/vu02a_200x48.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Learn critical concepts and practical methods to support research data planning, collection, storage and dissemination.","description":"","short_name":"datamanagement","target_audience":3,"faq":"<ul><li>What resources will I need for this class? <strong><i>\u00a0</i></strong></li></ul><div>For this course, you will need: 1)\u00a0an Internet connection; 2) software package capable of generating table-based CSV files (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Docs, Numbers);<br></div><div><i><br></i></div><ul><li>Why should I take this class?<strong>\u00a0</strong></li></ul>Data drives medical research and medical research drives scientific findings that ultimately result in improving human health. \u00a0This course will enable you to be play an integral part in the process.<br><p><br></p>","category-ids":["infotech","stats"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"","course_format":"The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 10 and 20 minutes in length with integrated quiz questions.
