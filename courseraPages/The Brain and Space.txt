It includes a history of vision research\ndating back to ancient Greece, and describes the role of the astronomer Kepler\nin deducing how the image of the visual scene is formed on the eye. &nbsp;How the two-dimensional projection of the\nvisual scene onto the surface of the retina is interpreted by the brain as a\nthree-dimensional world is explored through examples from various artists such\nas Magritte and Escher.</p>\n\n<b>2.&nbsp;Somatosensory<br></b><i>Body\n     sense:&nbsp; Measuring and mismeasuring\n     your own shape, and why negative numbers are hard (for your brain)</i><br><br>This unit covers how we know about\nthe positions of the parts of our bodies.&nbsp;\nSome intriguing illusions of body position sense are covered.&nbsp; The combination of body position sense and\nour sense of touch yields a sense of the three-dimensional location and shape\nof solid objects. <br><br><b>3.&nbsp;Brain maps<br></b><i>Brain\n     maps and polka dots</i>\n\n<p>This unit introduces the brain\nmechanisms responsible for sensory processing of vision and touch, with an\nemphasis on the formation of sensory maps in the visual and somatosensory\npathways of the brain.&nbsp; The implications\nof these maps and other neural response properties for perception of spatial\nlocation are explored, with an emphasis on object motion and contours.&nbsp; Experiments using electrical stimulation in\nsensory maps to probe their connection to perception are discussed.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p><b>4.&nbsp;Auditory</b><b><br></b><i>Sherlock\n     ear: how your brain finds sounds</i></p><p>This unit turns to a sensory\nsystem for which spatial location must be inferred from indirect\nmeasurements.&nbsp; For vision and touch, the\nsensory receptors are able to measure spatial location in kind:&nbsp; objects at different locations activated\ndifferent sensory receptors.&nbsp; For hearing,\nthe brain must compare and contrast the sounds arriving at each ear to make\ninferences about the location of origin.&nbsp;\nThis unit discusses the how this works, from the nature of sound itself\nto the interpretation of location-dependent sound attributes by the brain.</p>\n\n<p><b>5.&nbsp;Brain meters for space</b><b><br></b><i>Moving\n     with maps and meters</i></p><p>This unit introduces the concept\nof a \u201cmeter\u201d for spatial signals in the brain.&nbsp;\nMore commonly but somewhat obscurely referred to as rate coding, this\nkind of representation involves neural response rates that scale in proportion\nto spatial location \u2013 a meter whose level indicates position. This kind of code\nis used in movements, the sense of body position, and in the early stages of\nthe auditory pathway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>6. Reference frames</b><b><br></b><i>Defining\n     space: reference frames</i></p><p>Spatial locations are measured\nwith respect to reference positions, but these reference positions differ\ndepending on the type of sensory input.&nbsp;\nThe eyes measure locations with respect to the eyes, and the ears\nmeasure locations with respect to the ears.&nbsp;\nThis unit discusses some illusions related to this issue and describes\nbrain mechanisms for translating between different reference frames.&nbsp; Synthesizing a sense of space across time as\nthe body and its sense organs move through the environment requires integrating\nmemories of the sensory input at different times and positions.</p>\n\n<p><b>7.&nbsp;Navigation &nbsp;</b><b><br></b><i>Going\n     places: Balance, flow, steps and shortcuts</i></p><p>This unit shifts focus in two\nways:&nbsp; (a) it involves space on a larger\nscale such as traveling from one place to another, and (b) it involves a sense\nof one\u2019s own position in the environment as opposed to the position of objects\nor events in that scene.&nbsp; The role of the\nsense of balance and one\u2019s own movements are incorporated.&nbsp; Animal species that navigate long distances\nand how they do this are described.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<b>8.&nbsp;Space and memory</b><b><br><br></b>This unit builds the first of\nseveral important links between the sense of space and other kinds of\ncognition.&nbsp; Memory is closely linked to\nspatial processing at several levels.&nbsp;\nThis unit discusses the role of the hippocampus in both navigation and\nmemory, and tells the story of patient HM, whose hippocampus was surgically\ndestroyed in the 1950\u2019s, resulting in lifelong amnesia.<br><br><b>9.&nbsp;Thinking spatially</b><b><br><br></b>This unit argues that the\nspace-sensitive regions of the brain do much more than evaluate location.&nbsp; Instead, these areas are recruited for\ncognitive processes such as paying attention, making decisions, and planning\nfuture actions.&nbsp; The kinds of computations\nthat the brain performs on spatial inputs may resemble the kinds of\ncomputations that the brain performs on abstract concepts and ideas.&nbsp; Thinking about space and more general kinds\nof thinking may involve similar brain mechanisms.","course_format":"TBD","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5f/f01ef17fb6061a6c0e6f0f9661a883/brain_icon.jpg","suggested_readings":"There will be a suggested reading for this class. \u00a0Details will follow.","instructor":null,"categories":[{"id":10,"name":"Biology & Life Sciences","mailing_list_id":null,"short_name":"biology","description":"Our wide range of courses allows students to explore topics from many different fields of study.
