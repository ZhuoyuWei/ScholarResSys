{"about_the_course":"<div>In bringing about behavior change in public health, we often focus on\n    the individual mother, student, or farmer. We should not forget the community\n    structure and norms constrain for encouraging individual health behaviors.\n    This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote\n    the public\u2019s health. We begin by examining the various definitions of \u2018community\u2019\n    and the processes by which we \u2018diagnose\u2019 or seek to understand the structure\n    and characteristics of different types of communities. An appreciation\n    of community similarities and differences is necessary lest we fall into\n    the trap of designing one-size-fits-all interventions. We need to recognize\n    that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected,\n    we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community.\n    Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating\n    community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change\n    and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition\n    of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation\n    and evaluation of any intervention. We examine the concept of participation\n    in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability\n    of community change efforts. Finally a case study of a community participatory\n    approach to onchocerciasis control in Africa is presented. Community Directed\n    Intervention has subsequently been successfully applied to providing other\n    essential primary health care services by and in the community, such as\n    insecticide treated bednets, malaria treatment, vitamin A distribution,\n    deworming medicines, and pneumonia and diarrhea case management.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n</div>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b8/da9a8b0d9890437231557ecfb41e39/community_B-02.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/85/98b0ca74a8cc9afa7a0c775bdcc280/community_B-02.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/92/bbaec749f8fe409468077ef9085396/community_B-02.jpg","video":"xxDMpBRv0u8","university-ids":["jhu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/xxDMpBRv0u8/","id":74,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/0fb2d85007ca7f6d671b73e64a44d6/nursing.logo.large.horizontal.blue.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"JohnsHopkins","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico","website_facebook":"johnshopkinsuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png","background_color":"","id":8,"location_city":"Baltimore","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.29038480000000000,"location":"Baltimore, MD","primary_color":"#0061AA","abbr_name":"Johns Hopkins","website":"http://www.jhu.edu/","description":"The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.","short_name":"jhu","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"johnshopkins","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg","location_state":"MD","name":"Johns Hopkins University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/229e9cabab40da92cdd0fc46cd7e06/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/4b4ca39464d8fd3a75bf8a68d0a1d9/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-76.61218930000001000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"This course examines the community context of the changes needed to promote the public\u2019s health.","description":"","short_name":"communitychange","target_audience":1,"faq":"<ul>\n    <li><strong>What resources will I need for this class?</strong>\n\n        <p>There is no specific text book for the course.
