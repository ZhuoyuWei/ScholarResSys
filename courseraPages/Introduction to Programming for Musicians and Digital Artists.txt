{"about_the_course":"<p>The course, lecture, and examples build on each other to teach the fundamentals\n    of programming in general (logic, loops, functions, objects, classes) and\n    also deals with advanced topics including multi-threading, events and signals.\n    \u00a0Throughout the course, students create meaningful and rewarding expressive\n    digital \u201cinstruments\u201d that make sound and music in direct response to program\n    logic.\u00a0 The ChucK language provides precise high-level control over\n    time, audio computation, and user interface elements (track pad, joysticks,\n    etc.). \u00a0ChucK is used (unknowingly in most cases, via SMule Apps)\n    by millions of users throughout the world, and is the backbone of dozens\n    of academic programs and laptop orchestras. \u00a0Learning to program using\n    ChucK, through the musical examples provided in this course, will prepare\n    students to program in C++, Java, and other languages. There will be special\n    guest lectures from creators of the ChucK language, Dr.\u00a0Ge Wang (Stanford\n    University) and Dr. Perry R.\u00a0Cook (Princeton University).</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ab/addd108da2954eba7c93d4dd009dab78/KapurA.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ff/49290386db4456fd199ac5f89ee418/KapurA.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/07/60b208f85c8a1294621d334ea628d1/KapurA.jpg","video":"bdjo9Z7G6Mk","university-ids":["calarts"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/bdjo9Z7G6Mk/","id":443,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/63/7a864aeb70a49fdc5213ff5e7c1a3a/calarts-logo-orange-01.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"calarts","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"calarts","logo":"","background_color":"","id":59,"location_city":"Santa Clarita","location_country":"US","location_lat":34.38981620000000000,"location":"Valencia, Santa Clarita, CA","primary_color":"#0090D0","abbr_name":"CalArts","website":"http://calarts.edu/","description":"The California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) has earned an international reputation as the leading college of the visual and performing arts in the United States, and was recently ranked as America\u2019s top college for students in the arts by Newsweek/The Daily Beast.
