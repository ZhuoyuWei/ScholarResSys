{"about_the_course":"<p></p>\n<p>Probably the greatest challenge of the \u201c21st century of the brain\u201d is\n    to understand how subcellular and cellular neuronal processes give rise\n    to behavior \u2013 movement, perception, emotions, memory and creativity. This\n    course will discuss, step-by-step, how modern molecular, optical, electrical,\n    anatomical and theoretical methods have provided fascinating insights into\n    the operation of the elementary building blocks of brains and, most importantly,\n    how neuronal mechanisms underlie memory and learning processes. We will\n    next discuss why computer simulations are so essential for understanding\n    both neuronal \u201clife ware\u201d and the emergence of networks dynamics (e.g.,\n    as in the \u201cBlue Brain Project\u201d).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The course will start by highlighting a few recent brain-excitements,\n    including treating the sick brain via electrical stimulation, recent attempts\n    at \u201creading the brain code\u201d for brain-machine interfaces, new neuro-anatomical\n    techniques (\u201cBrainbow\u201d and connectomics) and physiological methods (optogenetics)\n    that enables us to record/activate the living, behaving brain at single\n    cell resolution. We will end by discussing emerging frontiers in brain\n    research, including the interaction between brain research and the arts.\n    As an added bonus, a lecture on perception, action, cognition and emotions\n    will be taught by an acclaimed neuroscientists, Prof. Israel Nelken..</p>\n\n</p>\n<p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/c648859f850740acdf49880106b7ce/logo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1e/5f58fd74b7279b8e606d28902ad85c/logo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5c/33e98a3dbe5d21b0acc299a0a319c6/logo.jpg","video":"SO7gq972SJ8","university-ids":["huji"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/SO7gq972SJ8/","id":197,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/75/bb0ffb201ed83c70c82ee322b05af0/logo-uni.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"HebrewU_heb","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/48/7cac159746dca5674234142a147d0f/HebrewSmallIcon2.png","website_facebook":"thehebrewuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/cc2204d8828b8160b075451990c655/160-60-coursera.png","background_color":"","id":24,"location_city":"Jerusalem","location_country":"","location_lat":31.79443100000000000,"location":"Sderot Shayeret Har HaTsofim, Jerusalem","primary_color":"#C12127","abbr_name":"Hebrew University","website":"http://new.huji.ac.il/en","description":"Ranked among the top academic and research institutions worldwide, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is Israel's leading university and premier research institution.
