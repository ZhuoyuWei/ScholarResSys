{"about_the_course":"As good teachers know, our most important resource(s) in classroom interaction\nare the ideas and experiences our students bring with them. The past two\ndecades of research on learning, and more recent framings of academic goals\n(especially the Common Core State Standards) bring this insight to the\nforefront. This short course, designed for as few as four weeks and as many\nas eight, asks how teachers can and do capitalize on what students bring\nto the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings \u2013 to\nadvance the learning of all students in the class.\n<br><br>Our overarching goal is to support participants in developing the knowledge\n    and skills needed to take up student thinking in ways that enable all students\n    to learn challenging subject matter \u2013 a practice we call \u201cleveraging student\n    thinking\u201d.<br>\n<p>Course content will focus primarily on middle grades classrooms in various\n    disciplines, but the practice of leveraging student thinking is applicable\n    to all subject areas and grade levels. Participants will explore the design\n    of curricular tasks, the analysis of patterns of talk, and the use of representational\n    tools to:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>elicit student thinking,</li>\n    <li>attend to significant features of that thinking,</li>\n    <li>interpret students\u2019 ideas within a developmental framework, and</li>\n    <li>bridge from students\u2019 current understandings to more sophisticated understandings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These ideas will be introduced through guided engagement with video cases.\n    Analysis of the video cases will highlight the elements involved in leveraging\n    student thinking, and also will illustrate the epistemic, academic, developmental\n    and managerial \u201cpressure points\u201d that challenge teachers\u2019 ability to capitalize\n    on student thinking in constructive ways.</p><p>Throughout the course, participants will further explore and test out these ideas in their own classrooms,\u00a0be they formal or informal. (A Sunday school class, a scout troop, a homeschool opportunity, or a traditional classroom environment would all be appropriate, but some kind of teaching practice is necessary to benefit from the course.)\u00a0 The goal is to\u00a0work on the work of teaching\u00a0<i>while</i>\u00a0teaching.</p><p>In addition, critical reflection with a group of partners is an important component of this course. \u00a0At\u00a0key\u00a0points, participants will be asked to document their work to share with peers for feedback.\u00a0Therefore, we strongly encourage teachers to\u00a0plan to work through\u00a0this course in teams (of two to four people) to facilitate mutual observation, analysis and discussion. Teachers\u00a0who\u00a0do not have a team at the beginning of the course\u00a0will be able to create a team through\u00a0online forums at the beginning of the course\u00a0and can exchange their teaching examples through video or narrative descriptions.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f5/ba51b564ff455bcf8873dc12e71cb5/coreThink_Icon.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/67/1b4a818d93fa5252566803f68351c4/coreThink_Icon.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/05/14b51d00de06b83d202b9e4e2900dc/coreThink_Icon.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["vanderbilt"],"video_baseurl":"","id":600,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5f/efe6c18424e8b389d27cf695278a01/Certificate-WideLogo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"vanderbiltu","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/76/5bf77c95f3afdcd6ff0c88fbf95693/vanderbilt_16x16_b.png","website_facebook":"vanderbilt","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d2/12379e6f5878e9a8e8df310afe7e26/vanderbilt_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":37,"location_city":"Nashville","location_country":"US","location_lat":36.16666670000000000,"location":"Nashville, TN, USA","primary_color":"#5A0F3B","abbr_name":"Vanderbilt","website":"http://www.vanderbilt.edu/","description":"Vanderbilt University, located in Nashville, Tenn., is a private research university and medical center offering a full-range of undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees.","short_name":"vanderbilt","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2f/42ef92a0781fdae4b1e6bd739d054f/Vanderbilt-Coursera-1280x320.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"vanderbilt","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d6/14e4aacad098aa3b2e2b3cda3112d1/vanderbilt_928x220.jpg","location_state":"TN","name":"Vanderbilt University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8f/64ec0b2f7b95b23b7e5f0537131e9c/Vanderbilt-Coursera-360x360.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/77/a41dee6237efd36fc2d22a7536acbe/Vanderbilt-Coursera-360x360.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/95/017818e00392a394c55112d2a726b4/Vanderbilt-Coursera.svg","location_lng":-86.78333329999998000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/89ec947a4081dd88dcea207ad21a59/vu02a_200x48.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"This course explores how teachers can capitalize on what students bring to the classroom - their ideas, perceptions, and misunderstandings - to advance the learning of all students in the class, a practice we call \u201cleveraging student thinking\u201d.
