{"about_the_course":"The emerging research communities in educational\ndata mining and<span><br>\nlearning analytics are developing\u00a0methods for mining and modeling the increasing\namounts of fine-grained\u00a0data becoming available about<br>\nlearners. In this class, you will learn about\nthese methods, and their<br>\nstrengths and weaknesses for\u00a0different applications. You will learn how to\nuse each method to\u00a0answer education research questions\u00a0and to drive intervention and improvement in\neducational software and\u00a0systems. Methods will be covered\u00a0both at a theoretical level, and in terms of how\nto apply and execute\u00a0them using standard software tools.\u00a0Issues of validity and generalizability will\nalso be covered, towards\u00a0learning to establish how trustworthy and\u00a0applicable the results of an analysis are.</span>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/95/f61aaa25018793982b34e18a05269e/chico-compy-v2.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/0f/daf5f9cde97c3372fdbcc5a4d44a26/chico-compy-v2.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/82573d90d69ae4a51c2c4ce8d6ba3c/chico-compy-v2.jpg","video":"6hay0d57Ntw","university-ids":["columbia"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/6hay0d57Ntw/","id":337,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"columbia","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/72/c9b56e3ff66fa6e1ca52bdea9440ae/ColumbialittleLOGO4.png","website_facebook":"Columbia","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/9b/42f2eca2f10769400d1f8519892413/ColumbiaLOGO.png","background_color":"","id":40,"location_city":"New York","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.71435280000000000,"location":"New York City, NY, USA","primary_color":"#1F2F60","abbr_name":"Columbia","website":"http://www.columbia.edu/","description":"For more than 250 years, Columbia has been a leader in higher education in the nation and around the world.
