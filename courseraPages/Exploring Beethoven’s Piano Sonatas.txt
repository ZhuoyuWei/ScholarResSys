{"about_the_course":"<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p></p><p>Our relationship to Beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one. For\nmany musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity,\nrigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled\nin the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to\nperformers. At the same time, Beethoven\u2019s music is casually familiar to\nmillions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically\ninclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture,\nyet still represents its summit.</p>\n\n<p>This course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas\nfrom the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata\nand an aspect of Beethoven\u2019s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the\nrelationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the\ncritical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of\nextremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in\nwhich the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the\ncharacter of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis\nand historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a\nmusicologist. Its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the\nperformer, even while embracing the eternal mystery of Beethoven\u2019s music\nitself.</p>\n\n<p></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/21/0e5c188aab1fd78c75197d360c1a11/coursera-lvb.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/474f16f71c8b518170ff1db947ccaf/coursera-lvb.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1a/3306f9e902fd6a5a87d3a98696b643/coursera-lvb.jpg","video":"OoYgbHYrkLE","university-ids":["curtis"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/OoYgbHYrkLE/","id":493,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"CurtisInstitute","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"CurtisInstitute","logo":"","location_lat":39.95233500000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"Philadelphia","location_country":"US","id":79,"location":"Philadelphia, PA","primary_color":"#006699","abbr_name":"Curtis","website":"http://www.curtis.edu/","description":"The Curtis Institute of Music educates and trains exceptionally gifted young musicians for careers as performing artists on the highest professional level.

For those who would like to explore the subject from a different perspective, though, there are several terrific studies of Beethoven:\n    <br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>[Alexander] <i>Thayer\u2019s Life of\nBeethoven</i>, in two extensive volumes, still, after well over a century, sets the standard for all Beethoven biographies. It is thorough and sober-minded without being dry. It is not the work of a musician, but as a look at the man\u2019s life, it is unmatched.\n        Edited by Elliot Forbes, it is available from the Princeton University Press.</li>\n    <li>Lewis Lockwood\u2019s <i>Beethoven: The Music and the Life</i>, published in 2005 by Norton, is very different and no less valuable. Far less exhaustive on Beethoven\u2019s biography than Thayer, Lockwood focuses on Beethoven\u2019s musical development, of which\n        he gives a beautiful account \u2013 scholarly, but definitely readable by a non-musician.</li>\n    <li>Beethoven\u2019s own letters are extremely revealing, and often very touching. Beethoven\u2019s mix of pride, stubbornness, and generosity is constantly on display, just as it is in the music. Dover has a collection of 457 of the letters, which touch on matters\n        both mundane (fees for compositions; details of publications) and excruciating (his deafness; his tragic relationship with his nephew).\n    </li>\n    <li>On a more musicological level, I cannot recommend Charles Rosen\u2019s works highly enough. Those without any musical background will probably find them very thorny. But for anyone who has studied music, both <i>The Classical Style</i> and <i>Sonata Forms</i> (Norton,\n        again) are works of art. The former has a chapter devoted to Beethoven, but really, every word of both books manages to explain how the music of the period works \u2013 not merely in an academic manner, but in a way that comes as close to explaining\n        the psychological power of this music as one can in words. Again, not essential as background for the course, but enthusiastically recommended for anyone who wants to go deeper into these pieces.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course, the best way to explore Beethoven\u2019s piano sonatas is to listen to them. There are countless great recordings of these works; the complete cycles that I grew up with are those of Artur Schnabel (EMI) and Richard Goode (Nonesuch). They are products of two very different eras, and therefore they collectively form a document of the relationship great musicians have had with Beethoven over the past 100 years.</p>\n\n<p>In the interest of full disclosure, I have written about Beethoven previously, on <a href=\"http://www.jonathanbiss.com\" target=\"_blank\">my website</a> and as a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Beethovens-Shadow-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B006MHF95G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1377978269&sr=8-1&keywords=beethoven%27s+shadow\">Kindle Single</a>. These writings are not specifically connected to the content of the course; they are more about my own personal relationship with Beethoven and his psychological effect on me, as a performer.\n</p>","instructor":"Jonathan Biss","categories":[{"mailing_list_id":11,"description":"Our wide range of courses allows students to explore topics from many different fields of study.
