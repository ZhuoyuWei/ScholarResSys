{"about_the_course":"This course provides an introduction to basic computational methods for\nunderstanding what nervous systems do and for determining how they function.\nWe will explore the computational principles governing various aspects\nof vision, sensory-motor control, learning, and memory. Specific topics\nthat will be covered include representation of information by spiking neurons,\nprocessing of information in neural networks, and algorithms for adaptation\nand learning. We will make use of Matlab demonstrations and exercises to\ngain a deeper understanding of concepts and methods introduced in the course.\nThe course is primarily aimed at third- or fourth-year undergraduates and\nbeginning graduate students, as well as professionals and distance learners\ninterested in learning how the brain processes information.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compneuro/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compneuro/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/compneuro/large-icon.png","video":"exBbVX0pYxo","university-ids":["uw"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/exBbVX0pYxo/","id":97,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UW","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/7480c1f9271144aa75fe024a1ad5a0/favicon-uw.ico","website_facebook":"UofWA","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/53/2f0ff155b3390e3d7190c363a4a045/uw-logo-coursera-transparent.png","background_color":"","id":15,"location_city":"Seattle","location_country":"US","location_lat":47.60620950000000000,"location":"Seattle, WA","primary_color":"#38255A","abbr_name":"Washington","website":"https://www.washington.edu/","description":"Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest state-supported institutions of higher education on the West Coast and is one of the preeminent research universities in the world.","short_name":"uw","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d0/f1be9c6b196a5a0446da96548a85b6/banner-uw1.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"user/uwhuskies","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5d/7f56a74b7b3009b4a888e372a41f67/banner-uw1.jpg","location_state":"WA","name":"University of Washington","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8a/903cf68039c31a207eb7eafff458f7/w-patch-purple.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/76/45ce3d3eba0b28c763eacbb2387322/w-patch-purple.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-122.33207080000000000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Understanding how the brain works is one of the fundamental challenges in science today.
