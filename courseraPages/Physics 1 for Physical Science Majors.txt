{"about_the_course":"<p>This course is a rigorous introduction to classical mechanics, which is the study of forces and motion.\u00a0 How does gravity control the motion of the\nplanets around the sun or the motion of a projectile fired from a cannon?\u00a0 Why does a spinning skater spin faster when\nshe pulls her arms in? \u00a0Why is a\nperpetual motion machine impossible? These are the kinds of questions which can\nbe answered with classical mechanics, which was first formulated by Isaac\nNewton around 1666. Classical, or Newtonian Mechanics is the oldest branch of\nphysics, but it will never go out of style.\u00a0\nIt remains the foundation of our understanding of the physical world and\nis constantly used by engineers and scientists. There is a space probe, called\nNew Horizons, that is on its way to Pluto right now, and it will arrive on July\n14, 2015, exactly on time and on target, because its path has been computed\nusing classical mechanics, and nothing\nmore.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a6/9827ee8f978e6fe67ae6585d5fa814/CourseraLogo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/79/91c94b68cf01a3340b49b2516112ff/CourseraLogo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6d/f6613e9892e60add07be5d4876cf2d/CourseraLogo.jpg","video":"AfdeGHfwBpM","university-ids":["boulder","cusystem"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/AfdeGHfwBpM/","id":487,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"cuboulder","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"cuboulder","logo":"","background_color":"","id":71,"location_city":"Boulder","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.01498560000000000,"location":"","primary_color":"#605221","abbr_name":"CU-Boulder","website":"http://www.colorado.edu/","description":"CU-Boulder is a dynamic community of scholars and learners on one of the most spectacular college campuses in the country.
