{"about_the_course":"In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for\neffective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software\nnecessary for a statistical programming environment, discuss generic programming\nlanguage concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language.\nThe course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes\nprogramming in R, reading data into R, creating informative data graphics,\naccessing R packages, creating R packages with documentation, writing R\nfunctions, debugging, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical\ndata analysis and optimization will provide working examples.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9d/193d89375944329ca3c0bf32b32c56/computing_B-02.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/97/aba290f88787a8c3b13a816837ab6c/computing_B-02.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/76/469a2849f2ae5a29cbefba53c82592/computing_B-02.jpg","video":"gk6E57H6mTs","university-ids":["jhu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/gk6E57H6mTs/","id":63,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/74/0fb2d85007ca7f6d671b73e64a44d6/nursing.logo.large.horizontal.blue.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"JohnsHopkins","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/80/d81353ccd0bab30962a5770d7aec97/favicon-jhu.ico","website_facebook":"johnshopkinsuniversity","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cf/0db65d1501244b9e6eacfa5e637fea/logo-jhu-front.png","background_color":"","id":8,"location_city":"Baltimore","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.29038480000000000,"location":"Baltimore, MD","primary_color":"#0061AA","abbr_name":"Johns Hopkins","website":"http://www.jhu.edu/","description":"The mission of The Johns Hopkins University is to educate its students and cultivate their capacity for life-long learning, to foster independent and original research, and to bring the benefits of discovery to the world.","short_name":"jhu","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/544537cee93c0acd67b6573d46a32e/Coursera-banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"johnshopkins","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/83/94437b11dcbef874ea1f30d960a26b/banner-jhu.jpg","location_state":"MD","name":"Johns Hopkins University","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/4b/229e9cabab40da92cdd0fc46cd7e06/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/4b4ca39464d8fd3a75bf8a68d0a1d9/JHUNewSquare.png","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-76.61218930000001000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"This course is about learning the fundamental computing skills necessary for effective data analysis.
