{"about_the_course":"This course covers intermediate topics on the structure and reactivity of organic compounds with an emphasis on electronic structure, pericyclic reactions and the chemistry of heteroaromatic compounds. Mechanistic concepts and models of reactivity are developed to build intuition about how organic compounds undergo their chemical transformations. An emphasis will be placed on developing problem-solving skills using frontier molecular orbitals to prepare students to think critically about the organic chemistry of living systems (e.g., nucleic acids, aromatic and heteroaromatic amino acids, etc.). This course and Part 2\u00a0are equivalent to a second-semester organic chemistry course, and these courses are especially suited for students in agricultural, nutritional and biological sciences, as well as premedical, predental, and preveterinary programs.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/orgchem2a/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/orgchem2a/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/orgchem2a/large-icon.png","video":"FxTEBTkpLMc","university-ids":["illinois"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/FxTEBTkpLMc/","id":141,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/6401c0ebc5e834eed7f5017d6d80fd/illinois-svg.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Illinois_Alma","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/2b/57d79bc1eb5b081e6a1b3729782566/favicon.png","website_facebook":"illinois.edu","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a9/ff5237ed042c63a02e67e2094e97c1/university-of-illinois-at-urbana-champaign.png","background_color":"","id":17,"location_city":"Cunningham","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.11058750000000000,"location":"Urbana, Illinois","primary_color":"#003C7D","abbr_name":"Illinois","website":"http://illinois.edu/","description":"The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a world leader in research, teaching and public engagement, distinguished by the breadth of its programs, broad academic excellence, and internationally renowned faculty and alumni.
