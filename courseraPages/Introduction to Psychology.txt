{"about_the_course":"This course will highlight the most interesting experiments within the\nfield of psychology, discussing the implications of those studies for our\nunderstanding of the human mind and human behavior. &nbsp;We will explore\nthe brain and some of the cognitive abilities it supports like memory,\nlearning, attention, perception and consciousness. &nbsp;We will examine\nhuman development - both in terms of growing up and growing old - and will\ndiscuss the manner in which the behavior of others affect our own thoughts\nand behavior. &nbsp;Finally we will discuss various forms of mental illness\nand the treatments that are used to help those who suffer from them. &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>The fact of the matter is that humans routinely do amazing things without\nappreciating how interesting they are. &nbsp;However, we are also routinely\ninfluenced by people and events without always being aware of those influences.\n&nbsp;By the end of this course you will have gained a much better understanding\nand appreciation of who you are and how you work. &nbsp;And I can guarantee\nyou that you'll learn things that you'll be telling your friends and family\nabout, things that will fundamentally change the way you think of yourself\nand others. &nbsp;How can you resist that?!","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/2a/4f4038f9a060f0f2e4fa50c2d6a857/iStock_000002041388_ExtraSmall.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a7/8e50c11598003ad1a2fd27999ec76f/iStock_000002041388_ExtraSmall.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/93/0ff63800e8b878da89ca45006bd392/iStock_000002041388_ExtraSmall.jpg","video":"YGAK1tW_Ovg","university-ids":["utoronto"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/YGAK1tW_Ovg/","id":328,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"uoftnews","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8e/773801b870a0cb946698134a77417d/favicon-utoronto.ico","website_facebook":"universitytoronto","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/78/334b4573e06c876cff8e2484f082d7/logo-utoronto-front.png","background_color":"","id":11,"location_city":"Toronto","location_country":"CA","location_lat":43.65322600000000000,"location":"Toronto, ON, Canada","primary_color":"#1C3361","abbr_name":"U of T","website":"http://www.utoronto.ca/","description":"Established in 1827, the University of Toronto has one of the strongest research and teaching faculties in North America, presenting top students at all levels with an intellectual environment unmatched in depth and breadth on any other Canadian campus.","short_name":"utoronto","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/84/774219ef720c726661c682cda7838a/UofT-Banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"universitytoronto","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6f/9a578312b814f8aeaf942f4f248447/banner-utoronto.jpg","location_state":"ON","name":"University of Toronto","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/04/1df8943d27a485a986a3ebf10c83d9/UofT-Crest-Square.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dd/cf4561b10afb34d449bb9574ecbca3/UofT-Crest-Square.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/06/0e2fff91e34df097bbb12ecd57c0af/UofT-Crest-Square.svg","location_lng":-79.38318429999998000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e0/c3219157fdcd439fb3b765c4b723e5/UofT-Crest-Wide.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"This course is all about you ... your mind, your behavior, and what underlies them both.
