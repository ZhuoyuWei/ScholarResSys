{"about_the_course":"<span><div>Join\n              internationally-acclaimed researcher and award-winning\n              educator Richard Alley in an exploration of the role of\n              energy in our environment and our future. Energy use has\n              done great good for humans by giving those in the\n              developed world the equivalent of 100 energy \"serfs\" to do\n              our bidding, making up roughly 10% of the economy, and\n              powering most of the economy.&nbsp; However, the unintended\n              consequences of energy use are affecting people around the\n              world and changing the climate in ways that will make life\n              much harder.&nbsp; Numerous options exist for development of a\n              sustainable energy system that provides a stronger\n              economy, more jobs, and greater security that is more\n              consistent with ethical principles.&nbsp; The course explores\n              these issues.<br>\n              &nbsp;<br>\n              \u201cEnergy, the Environment, and Our Future\u201d will combine\n              student-centered instructional materials and film clips\n              from the PBS TV series&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RyvpsIx47E\" target=\"_blank\">Earth: The Operators' Manual</a>, also\n              hosted by Richard Alley, to tell the history, present, and\n              possible futures of human energy use.&nbsp; <br>\n            </div>\n            </span><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d7/9278e1bee3d5e086477af9fde07330/alley_energy_course_graphic.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/94/0f7575f2bc66c8f2f8ee1a540e095e/alley_energy_course_graphic.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c9/2d9784b2f32b5280bf5fc352dfaee9/alley_energy_course_graphic.jpg","video":"8xvDz7YGg_Q","university-ids":["psu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/8xvDz7YGg_Q/","id":421,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e4/7ae3ae59aca95f9fa9dc4c88414f3f/PSU-Shield-Wide.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"penn_state","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/be/4a6da97cb18e3f0543e11305aeec3b/psu_favicon.png","website_facebook":"pennstate","logo":"","location_lat":40.79611110000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"College","location_country":"US","id":51,"location":"University Park, State College, PA, United States","primary_color":"","abbr_name":"Penn State","website":"http://psu.edu/","description":"Founded in 1855 as Pennsylvania's only land-grant university, The Pennsylvania State University combines academic rigor with a vibrant campus life.
