{"about_the_course":"Psychology, sociology, and neuroscience point to the existence of a set\nof developable character strengths that serve as building blocks for positive\nlife outcomes. That\u2019s why, in our view, character development and content\nmastery act as the two complementary halves of remarkable teaching. But\nthey\u2019re often perceived to be in competition. When you ask parents about\ntheir goals for their children, they almost always respond with terms like,\n<i>\u201csuccessful,\u201d \u201chappy,\u201d\n\u201ccurious,\u201d</i> and <i>\u201cbeing kind to others.\u201d</i> But when you ask schools\nabout their goals, they often reply in terms of academic content, like <i>\u201calgebra,\u201d \u201csubject-verb\nagreement,\u201d</i> and <i>\u201cthe periodic table.\u201d</i> \n<br>\n<br>Great teachers have always united those two visions.\n<br>\n<br>This course explores the interconnection between character research, education,\nand academic rigor. During our sessions, we\u2019ll cover the field of positive\npsychology as it relates to character strengths, as well as the concepts\nof Growth Mindset, Constructive Responding, and Character Behavior Language.\nWe will engage with the existing research, hear from eminent scholars in\nthe field and top K-12 educators, and view footage of classroom teachers\nintegrating these ideas into their classroom instruction.\n<br>\n<br>The course will explore questions like:\n<span>\n<br>\n<br></span>\n<ol>\n    <li>How can positive psychology help us maximize student engagement and accomplishment?</li>\n    <li>What does it look like to implement a <i>growth mindset</i> in your classroom?</li>\n    <li>Can you teach <i>grit</i> in the classroom? If so, how?</li>\n    <li>Should an educator measure character? If so, how?\n        <br>\n    </li>\n</ol>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/00/8b326b3e3abfec8b09c0ab27018a8c/54_Frank-01015216.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f0/c09133e1cd65d9861ac15e97dcb977/54_Frank-01015216.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/73/5f37a47ea52014c85b0d97d516e17f/54_Frank-01015216.jpg","video":"v6KCaI5lfTA","university-ids":["relay"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/v6KCaI5lfTA/","id":613,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"RelayGSE","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c1/8aa8e4ca6c35946b8f91513912604a/Relay_favicon_16x16.png","website_facebook":"relaygse","logo":"","background_color":"","id":104,"location_city":"New York","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.71435280000000000,"location":"New York City, NY","primary_color":"#234B8D","abbr_name":"Relay","website":"http://www.relay.edu/","description":"Relay Graduate School of Education is a ground-breaking graduate school with an innovative Master's degree program designed specifically to respond to today's urgent demand for effective and successful teachers.","short_name":"relay","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/33/6f7506dfbb987cddfd426df0222193/RelayBanner_1280x320.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"","partner_type":1,"banner":"","location_state":"NY","name":"Relay Graduate School of Education","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f5/a924018f6828c5edbe6f72cb2741c8/RelayLogoRev_360x360.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c5/245cce22b05563b313a2f0e453d9f5/RelayLogoRev_360x360.jpg","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-74.00597310000000000,"home_link":"","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/44/70e1f0b2cf80eb4a428a86c7c759aa/RelayLogo_200x48.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Positive psychology meets K-12 pedagogy.
