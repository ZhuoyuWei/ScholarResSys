{"about_the_course":"Popularized by movies such as \"A Beautiful Mind\", game theory is the mathematical modeling of strategic interaction among rational (and irrational) agents. Beyond what we call 'games' in common language, such as chess, poker, soccer, etc., it includes the modeling of conflict among nations, political campaigns, competition among firms, and trading behavior in markets such as the NYSE. How could you begin to model eBay, Google keyword auctions, and peer to peer file-sharing networks, without accounting for the incentives of the people using them? The course will provide the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions), repeated and stochastic games, and more. We'll include a variety of examples including classic games and real-world applications.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/gametheory/large-icon.png","preview_link":"https://class.coursera.org/gametheory-003/lecture/preview","small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/gametheory/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/gametheory/large-icon.png","video":"d1k7DNuRBoI","university-ids":["stanford","ubc"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/d1k7DNuRBoI/","id":20,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dc/581cda352d067023dcdcc0d9efd36e/favicon-stanford.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/4c69670e0826e42c6cd80b4a02b9a2/stanford.png","background_color":"","id":1,"location_city":"Palo Alto","location_country":"US","location_lat":37.44188340000000000,"location":"Palo Alto, CA, United States","primary_color":"#8C1515","abbr_name":"Stanford","website":"","description":"The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States.","short_name":"stanford","landing_page_banner":"","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"","partner_type":1,"banner":"","location_state":"CA","name":"Stanford University","square_logo":"","square_logo_source":"","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-122.14301949999998000,"home_link":"http://online.stanford.edu/","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/9a0294e2bf773901afbfcb5ef47d97/Stanford_Coursera-200x48_RedText_BG.png","display":true},{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a3/e2cb8d1fb2040ef7abcfcb42975509/UBC-logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"ubcaplaceofmind","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/159770b1b64f0bb3736e0a1ad5144b/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"universityofbc","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d1/4b45f1fa68329d09b869d990e5d48e/panel_signature3.png","background_color":"","id":29,"location_city":"Vancouver","location_country":"CA","location_lat":49.26487800000000000,"location":"The University of British Columbia, West Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada","primary_color":"#0F2144","abbr_name":"UBC","website":"http://www.ubc.ca/","description":"The University of British Columbia is a global centre for research and teaching.","short_name":"ubc","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1f/1a1a7375877cd97e0d8b02301e42e7/UBC-Coursera-Banner-1280x320.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"user/ubc","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/dd/396bbc8612e8d7bd419bdffa4c9f36/ubc4.jpg","location_state":"BC","name":"The University of British Columbia","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/38/521e5807d761297a1cf2dcc56ede8e/UBC-Coursera-Avatar-360x360.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/cc/5fd6b4afd6c4f42d006c13bcb3a3ff/UBC-Coursera-Avatar-360x360.jpg","square_logo_svg":"","location_lng":-123.25249600000001000,"home_link":"","class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1f/a1b550b8642963fd065c0315202ded/UBC-Coursera-Signature-200x48-v2.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"The course covers the basics: representing games and strategies, the extensive form (which computer scientists call game trees), repeated and stochastic games, coalitional games, and Bayesian games (modeling things like auctions).","description":"","short_name":"gametheory","target_audience":1,"faq":"<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a statement of accomplishment after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.
