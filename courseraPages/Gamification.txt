{"about_the_course":"<div>Gamification is the application of digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such as business and social impact challenges. Video games are the dominant entertainment form of our time because they are powerful tools for motivating behavior.\n    Effective games leverage both psychology and technology, in ways that can be applied outside the immersive environments of games themselves. Gamification as a business practice has exploded over the past two years. Organizations are applying it in\n    areas such as marketing, human resources, productivity enhancement, sustainability, training, health and wellness, innovation, and customer engagement. Game thinking means more than just dropping in badges and leaderboards; it requires a thoughtful\n    understanding of motivation and design techniques. This course examines the mechanisms of gamification and provides an understanding of its effective use.\n    <br>\n    <br><b>Subtitles for</b>&nbsp;<b>all video lectures available in</b>: English,&nbsp;Russian (provided by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://digitaloctober.com/\">Digital October</a>), Turkish (<a href=\"http://www.ku.edu.tr/en\">Koc University</a>)</div>\n<div></div>","subtitle_languages_csv":"ru,tr","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/gamification/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/gamification/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/gamification/large-icon.png","video":"rzihbzxC_6Y","university-ids":["penn"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/rzihbzxC_6Y/","id":32,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/14/c965e1f5cf9ead221ad770bd907f3a/Penn-logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"pennopencourses","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png","background_color":"","id":6,"location_city":"Philadelphia","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.95233500000000000,"location":"Philadelphia, PA","primary_color":"#0000FF","abbr_name":"Penn","website":"http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning","description":"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

Students who successfully complete the course above a threshold score will receive a Statement of Accomplishment signed by the instructor.\n<br>\n<br> <strong>\u2022 Who should take this course?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Anyone curious about gamification or games more generally. That might include: students in business, IT, design, engineering, games studies, or other related fields; employees at companies that could apply gamification to their business; technologists\nor entrepreneurs seeking to incorporate gamification into their projects; game designers wondering about business or social impact applications; investors wondering about the financial potential of the games industry; educators interested in gamification\nfor learning; video game aficionados excited about the deeper potential of games; or anyone seeking to deepen their understanding of an exciting new field.\n<br>\n<br> <strong>\u2022 What resources will I need?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Nothing, other than the ability to access the Coursera website and other sites on Internet. The lecture videos, homeworks, and exam will sometimes direct you to investigate a website or view a video for further information. You might even be asked to\nplay a game or two.\n<br>\n<br> <strong>\u2022 What does a typical class session look like?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>In most of the lecture segments, I\u2019ll describe gamification concepts and illustrate them with examples, screenshots, and diagrams. I\u2019ll often use real-world case-studies as illustrations. In a few of the segments, I will interview leading gamification\nexperts, executives, and investors.\n<br>\n<br> <strong>\u2022 Is the course gamified?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>No, not in the sense of having points and badges associated with course activities. Given the novelty of the course and the massive open online format, I didn\u2019t feel I could implement a gamified system that was technically feasible and supportive of the\nlearning experience in the available timeframe. Gamification isn\u2019t a solution for everything, and it\u2019s not always easy to do well! That being said, in the course I\u2019ll discuss examples of educators using gamification in effective ways. And there just might\nbe a game-like aspect or two of the lectures.\n<br>\n<br> <strong>\u2022 What will I learn from this course?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>That\u2019s largely up to you! The course provides a solid introduction to the concepts and practices of gamification, which can be applied in a number of ways. You\u2019ll be able to think about applying gamification to your business or your life, and to connect\ngamification with other fields such as marketing, strategy, IT, psychology, and design. And hopefully you\u2019ll see video games in a whole new light.\n<br>\n<br><strong>\u2022 Is this course different than the prior sessions Gamification on Coursera?</strong>\n<br>\n<br>This is another session of the same course. &nbsp;It has been revised to correct errors and&nbsp;update information, and restructured to allow more time for completing assignments, but it covers the same material as the 2012 and 2013 sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>","category-ids":["infotech","business"],"visibility":0,"course_syllabus":"<div>The course is divided into 12 units.
