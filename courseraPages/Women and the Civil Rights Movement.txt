{"about_the_course":"This\ncourse examines the U.S. civil rights movement from the vantage point of women,\nconsidering both women\u2019s involvement in the legal campaigns and political\nprotests and the impact of civil rights struggles on women\u2019s status and\nidentity.&nbsp; Taking a \u201clong civil rights\nmovement\u201d perspective, we begin in the late nineteenth century and consider\nevents, organizations, and personalities through the twentieth century. <br><br>Throughout\nwe will consider issues which have preoccupied historians, social movement\ntheorists, and historians alike:&nbsp;\ndeveloping and sustaining political commitment, assessing the strengths\nand weaknesses of various forms of political organization, maximizing influence\nand securing long-range objectives.&nbsp; We\nwill also examine competing definitions of leadership; class, race, and gender\ndynamics within the movement; and the cultural dynamics of political organizing\nand social change.&nbsp; <br><br>In the process, we\nconsider not only how the movement altered the status of African Americans in\nthe U.S. but the legacy of these struggles as they changed understandings of\ncitizenship and rights more broadly. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern throughout the course will be to\nnot only understand the historical narrative but also to see how historians\nwork to make sense of the past.<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/55/2aef3eb13aaf7ec3e668786de26c3a/banner_brown_lines.gif","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/9d/f8195cb776a2108bb5d7bba9be0523/banner_brown_lines.gif","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/72/8f6b8e2502675fa81c81013293b562/banner_brown_lines.gif","video":"0YnUMwGISu0","university-ids":["umd"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/0YnUMwGISu0/","id":167,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/34/994080afbadb0c7bffae332a673aaf/University_of_Maryland_Logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UofMaryland","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/81bc9a607b97fadd8a2fdd6b66bfc2/favicon_16x16.ico","website_facebook":"UnivofMaryland","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/fd/01ba206b961003d2e4eb052d0ceac6/primarylogosm.png","background_color":"","id":32,"location_city":"21, Berwyn","location_country":"US","location_lat":38.98969670000000000,"location":"College Park, Maryland, USA","primary_color":"#990000","abbr_name":"UMD","website":"http://www.umd.edu/","description":"The University of Maryland is the state's flagship university and one of the nation's preeminent public research universities.
