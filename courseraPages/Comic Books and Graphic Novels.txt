{"about_the_course":"The comic book pamphlet developed as an independent literary form in the 1930s and early 1940s and has been a favorite of adolescent enthusiasts and cult devotees ever since. Recently, it has entered into a process of transformation, moving from a species\nof pulp fiction on the margins of children\u2019s literature to an autonomous genre, one Will Eisner labeled the graphic novel. This transformation has been noted in such literary venues as the New York Times and the New Yorker, as well as in an increasing\nnumber of university classrooms and bookstore shelves.\n<br>\n<br>\u201cComic Books and Graphic Novels\u201d presents a survey of the history of American comics and a review of major graphic novels circulating in the U. S. today. It is focused on three main points. First, it argues that as comics develop in concert with, and\nparticipate in literary culture, they should be considered literature. Second, it reasons that such a designation forces us to redefine our concept of literature itself. Finally, it explores this transformative literary world by arguing that comics have\nmuch to teach us about ourselves.\n<br>\n<br>Get started by enrolling in an upcoming session, then print out the official course playset and get started!\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/xyO6Usw\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/xyO6Usw.jpg\"></a>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/39/4aba5c35176fca1e5e07fb3259d2a6/Comics-and-Graphic-Novels.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c8/39a91068003dd6743aff935688f0a8/Comics-and-Graphic-Novels.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d6/ba3d951f9beb0c015cc6fd9d453851/Comics-and-Graphic-Novels.png","video":"0KtF2-gZErg","university-ids":["boulder","cusystem"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/0KtF2-gZErg/","id":489,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":null,"wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"cuboulder","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"cuboulder","logo":"","background_color":"","id":71,"location_city":"Boulder","location_country":"US","location_lat":40.01498560000000000,"location":"","primary_color":"#605221","abbr_name":"CU-Boulder","website":"http://www.colorado.edu/","description":"CU-Boulder is a dynamic community of scholars and learners on one of the most spectacular college campuses in the country.
