{"about_the_course":"The University of California San Diego, Skaggs School of Pharmacy&nbsp;and\nPharmaceutical Sciences Drug Discovery, Development &amp; Commercialization\ncourse focuses on drug discovery, development and commercialization.&nbsp;\n<br>In this course, you will learn about the complete process of drug discovery,\ndevelopment, pharmacoeconomics, biosimilars, regulatory affairs, managed\nmarkets,&nbsp;portfolio management and strategic marketing of a new pharmaceutical\ndrug. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>Students will also learn that shifting the current drug discovery paradigm\nfrom \u2018finding new-entity drugs\u2019 to \u2018combining existing agents\u2019 may be helpful\nfor overcoming the current financial challenges that exist in the pharmaceutical/biotech\nmarket.&nbsp;\n<p>The following course objectives will be:</p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;Understand the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market a changing\n    landscape</p>\n<p>2. Understand the major aspects of the drug discovery process, starting\n    with target selection, to compound screening to designing lead candidates.\n    <br>\n</p>\n<p>3. Recognize current modern drug discovery based on the lock-and-key theory,\n    which attempts to use one single compound to hit one target to combat the\n    related disease.</p>\n<p>4. Increase understanding of the various drug discovery tools and methods\n    that are used for finding, identifying and designing a new drug.</p>\n<p>5. Define and understand the regulatory responsibilities for drug discovery,\n    including but not limited to, an Investigational New Drug Application (IND),\n    New Drug Application (NDA), and product labeling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;6. Incorporate study design methods for consideration in the design\n    of clinical protocols to access safety, tolerability, and efficacy in multiple\n    therapeutic areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;7. Identify the critical components for development of a commercialization\n    strategy and a marketing plan to launch a new drug.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/19/623ca2e7f8e7f6810168e995c56af5/IR.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/7f/df3d33134a11d893ea8dc861ff0b88/IR.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/83/66951066de213da55bf8eb5ef234ae/IR.jpg","video":"pJdVi_sLzh8","university-ids":["ucsd"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/pJdVi_sLzh8/","id":378,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/71/2c1c6e2435aa3ca018494c47b0e12d/UC-San-Diego-blue--gold.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"ucsandiego","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"UCSanDiego","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/03/f1bbcb4068ae9b1d93a066a39c2af3/UCSanDiego-Coursera-wide.png","background_color":"","id":53,"location_city":"San Diego","location_country":"US","location_lat":32.84722000000000000,"location":"La Jolla, San Diego, CA","primary_color":"#016691","abbr_name":"UC San Diego","website":"http://ucsd.edu/","description":"UC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report.
