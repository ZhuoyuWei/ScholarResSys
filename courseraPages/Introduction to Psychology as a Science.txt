{"about_the_course":"Since we were young children, we have tried to understand, to predict,\nand to control behavior. We first dealt with our parents and teachers,\nand later our friends and companions. This course shows, however,\nhow the understanding, prediction, and control of behavior require scientific\nvalidation. By using tools that are systematic and objective, psychology\nhas learned how people behave and think.\n<br>\n<br>Psychology is a very broad field of study and the course will include\ndiscussions of the brain and nervous system, sensation and perception,\nlearning, memory, intelligence and thinking, lifespan development, emotion\nand motivation, personality, social behavior, behavioral disorders, and\npsychological treatment of disorders. The course will include short\nlecture modules, demonstrations and experiments, and writing assignments.\n<br>\n<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/90/7e81c2cabe827f6f5cc98699f2d63f/Keith-QM-logo.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/fa/de9c8e284429161191e1885b4bc968/Keith-QM-logo.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/76/3ca532e355188460d39dc89398e865/Keith-QM-logo.png","video":"-Bls1ATgnXA","university-ids":["gatech"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/-Bls1ATgnXA/","id":322,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/f7803ce100fc4fd2ff4314a25995b3/Coursera-STO-logo-01.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"georgiatech","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/88/4d9c7e8a6ad0e787553d8b9d77d450/favicon-gatech.ico","website_facebook":"georgiatech","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/30/4b35cef753fcd6f13494279b65dc84/Georgia-Tech.png","background_color":"","id":9,"location_city":"Atlanta","location_country":"US","location_lat":33.77846260000000000,"location":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA","primary_color":"#C59353","abbr_name":"Georgia Tech","website":"http://www.gatech.edu/","description":"The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the nation's top research universities, distinguished by its commitment to improving the human condition through advanced science and technology.\n\nGeorgia Tech's campus occupies 400 acres in the heart of the city of Atlanta, where more than 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students receive a focused, technologically based education.","short_name":"gatech","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/24/0de4d4975ff698bdce7b8cf2f86c88/GT-Coursera-Banner.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"georgiatech","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ee/a21fe3506486f9ef6b5d7ca324d55f/banner-gatech.jpg","location_state":"GA","name":"Georgia Institute of Technology","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/27/a693dcb342a1ed209fdb0c2de7e6a3/GT-Coursera-logo-square.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/be/3e07cb47dd285544de28654fb24b18/GT-Coursera-logo-square.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/29/c5d764e8d4ad4eca175ca2f7a6ae40/GT-Coursera-logo-square.svg","location_lng":-84.39888059999998000,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c4/4371496c5361191aa6a9721cfbe1cf/Georgia-Institute-of-Technology.png","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Learn about how psychology has developed a body of knowledge about behavior and mind through the use of scientific methods.

There is a Spring Break during the week of March 17-21, 2014. Psychology is a broad discipline as you can see in the outline, and the course will\nsurvey the many areas studied by psychologists. Psychologists study the mind and behavior.<br>\n<br>This course was funded by a generous grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The QM certification mark recognizes that this course met Quality Matters review standards.\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><font color=\"#66ccff\">Prerequisite Knowledge</font></h3>\nThere are no prerequisites for this course.\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><font color=\"#66ccff\">Online Resources</font></h3>\nWe will be using material developed by Carnegie Mellon University called the Open Learning Initiative. The OLI material is divided into 56 modules and the course outline indicates which modules will be covered each week. Learning objectives are given\nat the beginning of each module.\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><font color=\"#66ccff\">Grading Policy</font></h3>\nThere will be a multiple choice quiz at the end of each week of lecture (11 quizzes total). The quizzes will be timed and you can only take each quiz only once. Quizzes will be available from 5:00 PM EST on Friday of each week until 5:00 PM on the next\nWednesday. The lowest quiz score will be automatically dropped. There will be a final exam at the end of the course. The overall allocation of quizzes and projects to the final grade are as follows::\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Quiz average: 50% of final grade</li>\n    <li>Final examination: 50% of final grade</li>\n</ul>A total score of 70% or higher will guarantee a passing grade in the course and a Statement of Accomplishment. Earning a score of 85% or higher will guarantee a passing grade in the course and a Statement of Accomplishment with Distinction.\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><font color=\"#66ccff\">Communication</font></h3>\nPlease communicate with the instructor and staff via the online forums. Because there are so many students, it is not possible for us to respond individually to every question. There will be a Q&amp;A forum where you can post your questions about the\ncourse. Students will have the opportunity to \"vote up\" questions they want answered, and the questions with the most votes will be answered either in a forum post or a video. Announcements from the instructor about the course will be sent via e-mail\nto all registered students and also will appear on the announcement page.\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><font color=\"#66ccff\">Netiquette</font></h3>\nWritten English language will be the primary means of communication. Please interact with your fellow students and the instructor in the discussion forums. There can be miscommunication as there is no intonation in these written communications. Please\nbe positive, supportive, and constructive in your comments and forum postings.\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><font color=\"#66ccff\">Expectations</font></h3>\nParticipants are expected to:\n<ul>\n    <li>Watch all lecture videos every week</li>\n    <li>Complete all quizzes and the final examination</li>\n    <li>Abide by the standards of academic honesty \u2013 plagiarism and any form of cheating will not be tolerated and will result in the removal of the participant from the course</li>\n    <li>Seek help if needed from your fellow students by using the forums</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><font color=\"#66ccff\">Honesty</font></h3>\nYour answers on quizzes and the exam should be your own.\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><font color=\"#66ccff\">Course Goals</font></h3>\nUpon successful completion of the course, students will be able to describe what psychologists study. They will be exposed to basic information about the different areas of psychology listed as different modules in OLI and weekly topics in the outline.\nThey will understand that we can understand behavior only by doing research to uncover the facts.\n<br>\n<br>Specific course goals are:\n<ol>\n    <li>Students will be able to recognize and describe major psychological principles, theories, and perspectives.</li>\n    <li>Students will be able to distinguish between different methods used by psychologists to study the different areas of psychology.</li>\n    <li>Students will be able to describe the nature-nurture controversy across different areas of psychology.</li>\n    <li>Students will know the basic principles in each area of psychology and how good research is required to understand these principles.</li>\n    <li>For each area of psychology, students will know how the nervous system and other biological systems are involved in understanding behavior in that area.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3><font color=\"#66ccff\">Course Outline</font></h3>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"15\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Week</th>\n            <th>Topic</th>\n            <th>Modules</th>\n            <th>OLI Modules</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Week 1\n                <br>January 13-17</td>\n            <td>Psychology as a Science</td>\n            <td>a.
