{"about_the_course":"<p>How is it that we are capable of transcendent kindness\u2014and\nunspeakable cruelty? How do we make sense of people\u2019s strongly-held opinions\nabout abortion, gay marriage, affirmative action, and torture? How do\nevolution, culture, and religion conspire to shape our moral natures?</p>\n\n<p>These are among the most important\u2014and most exciting\u2014questions\naround, and they are the focus of this course. We will explore the modern\nscience of moral belief and moral action, drawing upon disciplines such as\ncognitive science, neuroscience, economics, and philosophy. We will look at\nresearch from the lab, from the community, and from the battlefield; we will\ndiscuss babies, monkeys, and psychopaths; we will debate claims about moral\ndifferences between men and women, liberals and conservatives, Christians and\nMuslims. This course will cover prejudice and bigotry, sexuality and purity; punishment,\nrevenge, and forgiveness; and much much more.\u00a0</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p>As a preview, we have uploaded the introductory lecture to YouTube, which you can view here: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/1jUd72Dmd_A\">http://youtu.be/1jUd72Dmd_A</a></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/1b/3e547b83fa9412d2dab9bd085d6a07/shutterstock_45601228-sized.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f5/34d1914360cd2ff2e756b121363854/shutterstock_45601228-sized.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ee/efa58e71e9cb68079b66b54e08965f/shutterstock_45601228-sized.jpg","video":"62OOsXu42wc","university-ids":["yale"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/62OOsXu42wc/","id":684,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Yale","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"YaleUniversity","logo":"","background_color":"","id":109,"location_city":"New Haven","location_country":"US","location_lat":41.30815270000000000,"location":"New Haven, CT","primary_color":"#33338B","abbr_name":"Yale","website":"http://online.yale.edu/","description":"Yale University is one of the world's leading centers of learning and research.

","description":"","short_name":"moralities","target_audience":0,"faq":"<b><br>1. Do I need any special background to take this course?</b>\n\n        <br>No. If you can read a popular science book, or an article in a magazine\n        such as <i>The Atlantic</i> or <i>The New Yorker</i>, you should be able to\n        follow the lectures and readings.<br><b><br>2. Is this course for the faint of heart?</b>\n\n        <br>It is not. We will examine, from an objective and scientific perspective,\n        some beliefs that many of us hold sacred. We will discuss religion, politics,\n        and sex\u2014sometimes all at the same time. If this idea is disturbing, this\n        might not be the course for you.<br><b><br>3. Is this a psychology course?</b>\n\n        <br>Sort of. I am a psychologist and the questions that we\u2019ll be dealing with,\n        concerning how people behave and how people think, are fundamentally psychological\n        questions. And so we\u2019ll be talking a lot about research and theory from\n        psychology. At the same time, though, other disciplines have a lot of say\n        about our moral lives, and so we\u2019ll also be discussing work by philosophers,\n        economics, neuroscientists and other scholars.<br><b><br>4. I don\u2019t want to wait until 2014. Is there anything I can do\nto start right away?</b>\n\n        <br>Yes!

What are the big debates in the field of moral psychology?<p></p>\n<p><b>Week 2: Empathy</b>\n\n    <br>What role does empathy play in our moral lives? Is more empathy necessarily\n    a good thing? And what can we learn from the study of those who seemingly\n    lack normal moral feelings, such as violent psychopaths?</p>\n<p><b>Week 3: Universals</b>\n\n    <br>Here, we ask about which aspects of morality are universal. We discuss\n    evolution, cross-cultural research, and\u2014most of all\u2014the fascinating new\n    science of the moral life of babies.</p>\n<p><b>Week 4: Family, friends, and strangers\n</b> \n    <br>Our moral feelings are usually most powerful towards our kin (such as\n    our parents and our children) and our friends and allies. We will discuss\n    these special bonds, and use the tools of behavioral economics to explore\n    the controversial question of whether we are ever truly altruistic to strangers.</p>\n<p><b>Week 5: Differences</b>\n\n    <br>How does culture influence our moral thought and moral action? What role\n    does religion play? Why are some of us conservative and others liberal,\n    and how do political differences influence our sense of right and wrong?</p>\n<p><b>Week 6: The Big Answers\u00a0</b> \n    <br>We\u2019ll discuss some clever studies that show how our moral behavior is\n    powerfully influenced\u2014often at the unconscious level\u2014by the situations\n    that we find ourselves in. Such findings raise some hard problems about\n    determinism, free will, and moral responsibility. Most of all, if our actions\n    are determined by our brains, our genes, and our situations, in what sense\n    can we be said to be moral agents? The course will end by trying to address\n    this question.\u00a0</p>","course_format":"","has_full_data":true,"small_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/f5/34d1914360cd2ff2e756b121363854/shutterstock_45601228-sized.jpg","suggested_readings":"<p>My new book on morality\u2014<i>Just Babies</i><span>: <i>The Origins\nof Good and Evil</i></span>\u2014is now available.
