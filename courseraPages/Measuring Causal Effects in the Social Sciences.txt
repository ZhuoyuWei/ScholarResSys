{"about_the_course":"<p>In this course\nwe discuss how to identify causal effect in the social sciences. Causal effects\nare interesting whenever we want to understand <i>mechanisms</i>. <br></p><p></p><p>As\nan example we can think of the case of wage differentials across gender. This\nmay be due to either discrimination from employers or differences in unobserved\nbackground characteristics across gender. Usually we would like to think about\ndiscrimination as a mechanism whereas differences in background characteristics\nwould usually not been seen as a mechanism. So it may be important to be able\nto tell why there is pay differences across gender. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>To show\ncausal effects the provision of a statistical relationship is not enough.&nbsp; The fundamental problem in identifying causal\neffects is therefore a matter of research design and research strategy. <br></span></p><p>During the course we will\nexamine such research designs and strategies and look at the relevance of different assumptions behind these\nmethods. The course also addresses the benefits of experimental data and introduces several new statistical and econometrical methods designed to improve causal statements from\nnon-experimental and observational data.</p><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/dd/b5a71597c2af418b368e7e8fc85654/social_science.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ff/c2d28733fdbdfefcd5f7eb5330fe42/social_science.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bf/793760af781056e40aa8cc0598c991/social_science.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["ucph"],"video_baseurl":"","id":401,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"uni_copenhagen","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/55/45a9eafa2bfdb29d961f8472a0b7fa/favicon_fa.ico","website_facebook":"universitet","logo":"","location_lat":55.67609680000000000,"background_color":"","mailing_list_id":null,"location_city":"kbh","location_country":"DK","id":63,"location":"Copenhagen, Denmark","primary_color":"#901A1E","abbr_name":"UCPH","website":"http://www.ku.dk/english","description":"The University of Copenhagen is the oldest University in Denmark - founded in 1479, and with over 38,000 students and more than 9,000 employees.
