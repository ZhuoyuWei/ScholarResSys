{"about_the_course":"<p><span>Designing Cities is a ten-week\ncourse starting in October 2013.\u00a0\u00a0Every\nweek will focus on a different aspect of Designing Cities including: How\nToday\u2019s City Evolved; The Ideas That Shape Cities; Tools for Designing Cities;\nMaking Cities Sustainable; Cities in the Information Age; Preserving Older\nCities; Designing New Cities, Districts and Neighborhoods; The Challenges of\nInformal Cities and Disadvantaged Neighborhoods; and\u00a0Visionary Cities.<b>\u00a0\u00a0</b>Materials will be presented by the\ninstructors and guest faculty from PennDesign through a series of five or more\u00a0modules per week, each typically 10-12\nminutes long.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p>The first module each week will be a roundtable discussion among\nprofessors Stefan Al, Jonathan Barnett, and Gary Hack introducing the big issues\nassociated with the subject.\u00a0\u00a0Each\nsucceeding module will be a self-contained illustrated presentation of a set of\nideas and images. There will be a list of suggested readings for those who wish\nto follow up on the ideas in each module.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone enrolled in Designing Cities will be expected to\ncomplete 3 assignments.\u00a0\u00a0These\nwill be posted on the course site and they will be in the form of peer assessments. There will also be three sessions where we discuss a selection of\nthe assignments that have been submitted. There will be a great deal to be\nlearned from the ideas participants submit, reflecting cities of all sizes and\ncircumstances across the globe.</p>\n\nThe course concludes with a\ndiscussion by the faculty of the issues raised in the discussion groups and\nresponses to the assignments. We are looking forward to connecting with you and\nseeing the issues at the forefront in designing your city. \u00a0","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/b1/6950e83c53eeb6a6d35336f00ad4cb/Logo2.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/12/5f3290c6e735ec3b708b98012a5e2b/Logo2.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/42/1b45a9a5fdd47413d0acb842391f75/Logo2.jpg","video":"6y5kXSLbpkE","university-ids":["penn"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/6y5kXSLbpkE/","id":716,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/14/c965e1f5cf9ead221ad770bd907f3a/Penn-logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"pennopencourses","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png","background_color":"","id":6,"location_city":"Philadelphia","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.95233500000000000,"location":"Philadelphia, PA","primary_color":"#0000FF","abbr_name":"Penn","website":"http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning","description":"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.
