{"about_the_course":"Can\nthe present outstanding records in cycling team time trials be\nfurther improved? Can the present world and Olympic records in\nathletics disciplines such as the 100 m sprint be advanced? This\ncourse provides the answer to these questions. It shows that\naerodynamic processes in sports and around buildings are very complex\nand that many misconceptions exist. These misconceptions are caused\nby the often counter-intuitive flow physics. Interestingly, the same\ncounter-intuitive flow physics govern the misconceptions in both\nsports and building aerodynamics. The insights from this course will\nhelp you to understand and improve the performance of top athletes\nand of modern building design. <br><br>In\n2013, team Orica-Green Edge set the fastest-ever average speed for a\nTour de France team time trial, with 57.8 km/h over a distance of 25\nkm, beating team Omega-Pharma Quick-Step by a mere 0.75 s. At the\nsubsequent 2013 UCI Road World Championships, the latter team beat\nthe former by only 0.88 s. Clearly, even minor aerodynamic\nimprovements can be decisive in these prestigious races. And,\nsurprisingly, up to now, the optimum aerodynamic setting for a team\ntime trial has not yet been explored.<br><br><p>\nRecords\nin athletics races such as the 100 m sprint, the 110 m hurdles and\nthe long jump are only validated by the IAAF (International\nAssociation of Athletics Federations) when the tail wind does not exceed\n2 m/s. Most world and Olympic records have been established at tail\nwinds close to 2 m/s. Clearly, local aerodynamic effects can be\ndecisive in establishing new records. Also here, the optimum\naerodynamic setting has not yet been explored.</p>\n<p>\nNew\nand prestigious building projects are realized in different parts of\nthe world. Some of them feature the integration of wind energy\nsystems in the building design. Also here, aerodynamic misconceptions\ncan lead to suboptimal performance. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe\ncourse starts with a brief recapitulation of the basic aspects of\nfluid flow: statics, kinematics, dynamics, flow regimes and boundary\nlayers, including the atmospheric boundary layer in which sports and\nbuilding aerodynamics take place. Next, the main aspects of the\naerodynamic analysis techniques of wind tunnel testing and\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are outlined. Tips and\ntricks for wind tunnel testing and CFD simulations are given. This\nknowledge provides the basis for the course parts on building\naerodynamics, 100 m sprint aerodynamics and cycling aerodynamics,\nwhere some surprising and sometimes spectacular results will be\nshown.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/13/0c7d2e5ac13e3a0241d6ca00b56597/thumbnail.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/5a/16fea561d1c8a4021a2d77c9ebd165/thumbnail.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/67/29eb410a106f95c5f99219f6b73a05/thumbnail.jpg","video":"","university-ids":["tue"],"video_baseurl":"","id":1162,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"TUeindhoven","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7f/b1e2bdeadc7e3a05f4b964dcce609f/Logo-TUe-favicon.png","website_facebook":"TU.Eindhoven","logo":"","background_color":"","id":177,"location_city":"Eindhoven","location_country":"NL","location_lat":51.44843740000000000,"location":"Den Dolech, TU-terrein, Eindhoven, Nederland","primary_color":"#0067B3","abbr_name":"TU/e","website":"http://www.tue.nl/en","description":"Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) is a research-driven, design-oriented university of technology with a strong international focus.
