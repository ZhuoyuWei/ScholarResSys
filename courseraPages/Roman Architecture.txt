{"about_the_course":"<p>This course is an introduction to the great buildings and\nengineering marvels of Rome and its empire, with an emphasis on urban planning\nand individual monuments and their decoration, including mural painting. While\narchitectural developments in Rome, Pompeii, and Central Italy are highlighted,\nthe course also provides a survey of sites and structures in what are now North\nItaly, Sicily, France, Spain, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Croatia, Jordan,\nLebanon, Libya, and North Africa. Many of the learning materials presented in\nthis course will be adapted from the Roman Architecture course Professor\nKleiner provided as part of the Open Yale Courses project. The lectures are\nillustrated with over 1,500 images, many from Professor Kleiner's personal\ncollection<i>.</i></p><p>As I mentioned in my introductory\nvideo above, the Roman Empire was centered in Rome but encompassed a vast area on\nthree continents. And the impact of its architecture since then is even broader\nthan that.&nbsp;The global reach of the empire makes Roman architecture a\nperfect subject for our global society and having community moderators from\naround the world would add immeasurably to the course experience.&nbsp;</p><p>For that reason, I am seeking a few\n\"community moderators\" to volunteer their time to collaborate with me\nand my Teaching Fellow, Meghan Freeman, who is working on her PhD in Roman Art\nand Architecture at Yale.&nbsp;I am hoping to identify a small number of\nstudents willing, once the course begins,&nbsp;to devote approximately four\nhours each week to help me and Meghan interact on the forum, answer questions\nfrom classmates, and&nbsp;perhaps even participate in a live video session!\n&nbsp;I am hoping to attract volunteers from around the world and with varied\neducational and professional backgrounds.&nbsp;</p><p>If you would like to apply to become a\nvolunteer community moderator for my Roman Architecture course on Coursera,\nplease click the link below to fill out an application.&nbsp;</p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uNzIVCs5OpDl4w4pXjeLswNGXKiqO70XwIMWbeg63N8/viewform\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uNzIVCs5OpDl4w4pXjeLswNGXKiqO70XwIMWbeg63N8/viewform</a></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/83/eb2216a234b60fee3255eef5741126/deek_courselogo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/bf/6e901d4a18040693ebec348c841725/deek_courselogo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/96bb86b6f727c154bb07d83cf2674c/deek_courselogo.jpg","video":"_lpaRFskvt4","university-ids":["yale"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/_lpaRFskvt4/","id":678,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Yale","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"YaleUniversity","logo":"","background_color":"","id":109,"location_city":"New Haven","location_country":"US","location_lat":41.30815270000000000,"location":"New Haven, CT","primary_color":"#33338B","abbr_name":"Yale","website":"http://online.yale.edu/","description":"Yale University is one of the world's leading centers of learning and research.
