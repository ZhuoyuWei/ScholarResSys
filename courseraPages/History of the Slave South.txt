{"about_the_course":"<p>Within the United States, the pre-Civil\nWar South was a distinct region of plantations, enslaved labor, and\nagricultural production for the export market. It was always part of a global\neconomy, tied into networks of capital, labor, and commodity markets that\nspanned continents. The wealth of the slave South was absolutely central to the\npolitical and economic growth of the U.S. and its emergence as a continental\nempire in the nineteenth century, but ultimately that system had to be\ndestroyed for the country to claim its place as a world power.<br>\n<br>\nWhy that was \u2013 why the U.S. experienced a brutal Civil War in the 1860s \u2013 is a\nmatter of considerable contention among scholars and a central theme of the\ncourse. The history of the South is a crucial part of the story of the rise of\nthe U.S. as a global power and it is particularly compelling because of its\nhistory as a slaveholding society, the wealthiest in the western world in 1860.\nThis course is about the ethical and political questions that history\nnecessarily poses about the relationship between slavery, capitalism, and\ndemocracy in U.S. and world history. \u00a0It\u00a0is about the rise and fall\nof the slave South from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the end of\nthe American Civil War.<b></b></p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/6e/9d13bb94639ed4ce6f36266abdbd20/Jefferson_Slave-Image3.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/59/4e3fc4a24c62fcb31fc3955d8d7afa/Jefferson_Slave-Image3.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/72/c0bba42d4469a07105a6d2e1e9a982/Jefferson_Slave-Image3.jpg","video":"CrvyPl6cSBQ","university-ids":["penn"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/CrvyPl6cSBQ/","id":1039,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/14/c965e1f5cf9ead221ad770bd907f3a/Penn-logo.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"pennopencourses","china_mirror":2,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f3/2ca37fd0d5d009a94e0ba7f284c860/favicon-penn.ico","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/7c/5d03cbe2cb87974be7f83cc1080af8/logo-penn-front.png","background_color":"","id":6,"location_city":"Philadelphia","location_country":"US","location_lat":39.95233500000000000,"location":"Philadelphia, PA","primary_color":"#0000FF","abbr_name":"Penn","website":"http://provost.upenn.edu/initiatives/openlearning","description":"The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.
