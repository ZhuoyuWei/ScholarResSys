{"about_the_course":"Functional analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with spaces of\nfunctions. It is a valuable tool in theoretical mathematics as well as\nengineering. It is at the very core of numerical simulation.\n<br>\n<br>In this class, I will explain the concepts of convergence and talk about\ntopology. You will understand the difference between strong convergence\nand weak convergence. You will also see how these two concepts can be used.\n<br>\n<br>You will learn about different types of spaces including metric spaces,\nBanach Spaces, Hilbert Spaces and what property can be expected. You will\nsee beautiful lemmas and theorems such as Riesz and Lax-Milgram and I will\nalso describe Lp spaces, Sobolev spaces and provide a few details about\nPDEs, or Partial Differential Equations.\n<br>\n<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a3/789ad4ff56b0b713229b88d2e178e8/functionnal-analysis.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/49/a70f1a7871cf87c14ac22e7c4af299/functionnal-analysis.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/01/fcd5d9b3790ec571920c3edfd5481f/functionnal-analysis.jpg","video":"Df7tNA4Iegs","university-ids":["ecp"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/Df7tNA4Iegs/","id":765,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/98/49966a1e7aebf1e35bfe46127c1c39/logo-coursera-wide.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"centraleparis","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"ecolecentraleparis","logo":"","background_color":"","id":128,"location_city":"Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry","location_country":"FR","location_lat":48.77189600000000000,"location":"Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, France","primary_color":"#745E5E","abbr_name":"ECP","website":"http://www.ecp.fr/","description":"Since its creation in 1829, Ecole Centrale Paris, a French Ivy League \"Grande Ecole\" has trained high-level engineers.
