{"about_the_course":"Through this course, students will acquire a solid foundation \nin algebra and trigonometry. The course concentrates on the various \nfunctions that are important to the study of the calculus. Emphasis is \nplaced on understanding the properties of linear, polynomial, piecewise, \nexponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions. Students will \nlearn to work with various types of functions in symbolic, graphical, \nnumerical and verbal form.<br><br><br>THE SIGNATURE TRACK OPTION\n<p>Signature Track is an optional path you may choose for this course. \nBy signing up and paying a nominal fee (financial aid can be provided), \nyou can add a higher level of identity verification to your Coursera \ncoursework. If you achieve the threshold score,\n    you have the opportunity to earn a Verified Certificate. For each assignment, your identity is \nconfirmed through your photo and unique typing pattern. If you earn a \nVerified Certificate, you will also be given a\n    personal URL through which your course records can be shared with \nemployers and educational institutions.</p><p>Click <a title=\"Link: https://www.coursera.org/signature/guidebook\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/signature/guidebook\">here</a> for more information on the Signature Track option.<br></p><p><br></p>\nTHE COLLEGE CREDIT RECOMMENDATION OPTION\n<p>This Pre-Calculus course has been evaluated and recommended by the \nAmerican Council on Education\u2019s College Credit Recommendation Service \n(ACE CREDIT) for college credit so you can get a head start on your \ncollege education. More than 2,000 higher education\n    institutions consider ACE credit recommendations for transfer to \ndegree programs. If you add this option, towards the end of the course, \nyou will take an online proctored exam which will be combined with your \ncoursework to determine your eligibility\n    for college credit recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>Click <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/signature/college-credit-guidebook\">here</a> for more information on ACE College Credit recommendation.</p><br><br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/8f/f5e6bdde22289bb4a1a813121ab04b/math1b-course-logo.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c1/32121a42fb56a015b6485d4dc37155/math1b-course-logo.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e5/03280804e50fee3058d12b69011a91/math1b-course-logo.jpg","video":"ZZ_GfZgYK3Q","university-ids":["uci"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/ZZ_GfZgYK3Q/","id":210,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/33/e75ec0e47204f7a8f928ca487d52ee/logo_uci_rectangle_vector.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UCIrvine","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/21/fe2ddd0d8a37bbb16033878eac3d75/16x16_uci.png","website_facebook":"","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/30/f54378236f5403bb12ad3d06123fa9/logo_uci_rectangle_160x60.png","background_color":"","id":30,"location_city":"Irvine","location_country":"US","location_lat":33.68394730000000000,"location":"Irvine, CA, USA","primary_color":"#008C44","abbr_name":"UC Irvine","website":"http://uci.edu/","description":"Since 1965, the University of California, Irvine has combined the strengths of a major research university with the bounty of an incomparable Southern California location.
