{"about_the_course":"We have learned a lot recently about how the Universe evolved in 13.7 \nbillion years since the Big Bang. \u00a0More than 80% of matter in the \nUniverse is mysterious Dark Matter, which made stars and galaxies to \nform. \u00a0The newly discovered Higgs-boson became frozen into the Universe a\n trillionth of a second after the Big Bang and brought order to the \nUniverse. \u00a0Yet we still do not know how ordinary matter (atoms) survived\n against total annihilation by Anti-Matter. \u00a0The expansion of the \nUniverse started acceleration about 7 billion years ago and the Universe is \nbeing ripped apart. \u00a0The culprit is Dark Energy, a mysterious energy \nmultiplying in vacuum. \u00a0I will present evidence behind these startling \ndiscoveries and discuss what we may learn in the near future.<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/01/79ad8cec76fd0466ab76641cadd79d/c_FromtheBigBangtoDarkEnergy.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/e6/7e8ce60d9af7059cdfdc3f7411f7e3/c_FromtheBigBangtoDarkEnergy.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/93/cde5c9d8fe55ddd1531885f031ebd3/c_FromtheBigBangtoDarkEnergy.jpg","video":"TGHqg9HuxkE","university-ids":["todai"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/TGHqg9HuxkE/","id":483,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"Todai_News_en","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"","website_facebook":"Todai.News.en","logo":"","background_color":"","id":76,"location_city":"","location_country":"JP","location_lat":35.68948750000000000,"location":"Tokyo, Japan","primary_color":"#52A8FF","abbr_name":"Todai","website":"http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/","description":"The University of Tokyo, also known as \"Todai\", was established in 1877 as the first national university in Japan.
