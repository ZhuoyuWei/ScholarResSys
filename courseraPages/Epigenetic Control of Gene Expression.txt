{"about_the_course":"<p><b></b>While the human genome sequence has\ntransformed our understanding of human biology, it isn\u2019t just the sequence of\nyour DNA that matters, but also how you use it! How are some genes activated\nand others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Epigenetics has been a hot topic for research\nover the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control\ncontributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable\nthrough cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to\nmutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations,\nepigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be\nmanipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that\nepigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet),\nwhich has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.</p>\n\n<p>This course will give an introduction to the\nfundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that\nare manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on\nmammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the\nenvironment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.</p>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c6/bf774b544bd9718e7ed7247e0e2611/Big480x270_withcopyright.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/a3/d40a84374147e6dcb20dc0cd458f10/Big480x270_withcopyright.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/74/92c169ff99f49dfb3136297330ccb0/Big480x270_withcopyright.jpg","video":"MId1SMqUspA","university-ids":["unimelb"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/MId1SMqUspA/","id":173,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/72/4f6e42ac66db3c62341bc3b1397ca6/CourseEraSecondary.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"unimelb","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/c2/fc137263568a25c66e2cc5f98ca899/UOM_16x16pxLogo.png","website_facebook":"melbuni","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/58/59304da07d93c8a2cbfc5ac4c6a269/Mel1.png","background_color":"","id":33,"location_city":"Melbourne","location_country":"AU","location_lat":-37.81410700000000000,"location":"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","primary_color":"#003366","abbr_name":"UniMelb","website":"http://www.unimelb.edu.au/","description":"The University of Melbourne is an internationally recognised research intensive University with a strong tradition of excellence in teaching, research, and community engagement.
