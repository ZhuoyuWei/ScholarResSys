{"about_the_course":"Interprofessional health care informatics is a graduate-level, hands-on interactive exploration of real informatics tools and techniques. We will be incorporating \u00a0technology-enabled educational innovations to bring the subject matter to life. Over the 10 weeks that we study together, we will create a vital online learning community and a working healthcare informatics network. <br><br>We will explore perspectives of clinicians like dentists, physical therapists, nurses, and physicians in all sorts of practice settings worldwide. Emerging technologies, telehealth, gaming, simulations, and eScience are just some of the topics that we will consider. <br><br>Throughout the course, we\u2019ll focus on creativity, controversy, and collaboration - as we collectively imagine and create the future within the rapidly evolving healthcare informatics milieu. All healthcare professionals and IT geeks are welcome! <br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/d5/9752af8f689bbe28e9ace2e3a9054d/Final-Health-Informatics.jpg","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/49/392534d539814315e4ac197f672980/Final-Health-Informatics.jpg","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/41/a5f93b29848fe1bcb8ee8c30bbdd1f/Final-Health-Informatics.jpg","video":"ZGiLIDrpZ-0","university-ids":["minnesota"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/ZGiLIDrpZ-0/","id":382,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/32/051960873fd1cc2b6a315b80853ff2/minnesota.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"UMNews","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/f2/c0c3766390def44d6704f82d4d7955/favicon.ico","website_facebook":"UofMN","logo":"","background_color":"","id":50,"location_city":"Minneapolis","location_country":"US","location_lat":44.98333400000000000,"location":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","primary_color":"#7A0019","abbr_name":"Minnesota","website":"http://www.umn.edu/","description":"The University of Minnesota is among the largest public research universities in the country, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional students a multitude of opportunities for study and research.
