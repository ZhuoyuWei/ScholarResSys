{"about_the_course":"The goal of the course is to develop a complete working set of digital signal processing notions from the ground up. DSP is arguably at the heart of the \u201cdigital revolution\u201d that, in the space of just a few decades, has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of information availability. <br><br> In the class, starting from the basic definitions of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/dsp/large-icon.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/dsp/small-icon.hover.png","large_icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera/topics/dsp/large-icon.png","video":"rRUp2PVDJ_A","university-ids":["epfl"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/rRUp2PVDJ_A/","id":121,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/89/7f14b8c6f54b56a2446c99b2b8df86/EPFL_LOG_QUADRI_Red_resized.svg","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"EPFL","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ba/142188830b51c8c51b95cc25e5dbf3/epflfav.png","website_facebook":"EPFL.ch","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1d/0a73c737b332745aac47797f57cda4/logo-epfl-front.png","background_color":"","id":16,"location_city":"Lausanne","location_country":"CH","location_lat":46.51996170000000000,"location":"Lausanne, Switzerland","primary_color":"#7E000C","abbr_name":"EPFL","website":"http://www.epfl.ch/","description":"","short_name":"epfl","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/22/b50d471bc34471c5a7c696b1d714cc/rolex_learning_center.jpg","mailing_list_id":null,"website_youtube":"user/epflnews","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ab/bb616e071f67f5bcaead9b67dbaa36/banner-epfl.jpg","location_state":"VD","name":"\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/01/a5c9c211331132096e7ba9942dbd51/square_epfl_400.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/5f/f441e9c1630625018763c3b86cf582/square_epfl_400.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a7/fca9be507583b1f25e0fcd9fca0d59/square_epfl_400.svg","location_lng":6.63359709999997450,"home_link":null,"class_logo":"","display":true}],"self_service_course_id":null,"short_description":"Learn the fundamentals of digital signal processing theory and discover the myriad ways DSP makes everyday life more productive and fun.","description":"","short_name":"dsp","target_audience":1,"faq":"<ul>\n<li><strong>Will I get a certificate after completing this class?</strong>\n<p>Yes.

With DSP, as long as you have a PC, you have a portable and indestructible lab in which you can quickly assemble prototypes of your favorite circuits, from guitar effects to data communication systems.

DSP chips are specialized microprocessors designed to perform very efficiently the set of operations that are most common in digital signal processing. Many DSP chips exist and there is a rich body of literature on DSP chip programming. However, in this class we will deal with the fundamentals of signal processing in more abstract terms, and focus less on the specifics of a particular implementation strategy.

He is known for his work on wavelets and filter banks, used in media standards like MP3 and JPEG. <br><br> Several years of undergraduate teaching have coalesced into a co-written textbook: Signal Processing for Communications (EPFL Press, 2009).
