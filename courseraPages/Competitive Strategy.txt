{"about_the_course":"<p>This course\nis about the behavior of companies in\ncompetitive markets. Facing competition forces firms to look ahead and\nanticipate developments: If my rivals are likely\nto react to a price cut, I will have to take the expected reaction into account.\nWe focus on such instances of \u201cstrategic\ninterdependencies\u201d in real business situations.\nWe will first study the basic concepts of game theory as a toolbox with which we will\nthen analyze strategic \u201cgames\u201d in real-life settings. Rather than a set\nof checklists of \u201chow-to-behave\u201d in a number of\nprespecified situations, this course will teach you to think about business\nstrategy in a systematic and exciting - and\nultimately more successful - way!</p>\n\nWe will use our toolbox to\naddress and analyze different decisions firms take: Why do firms preannounce\ntheir products? How do price wars happen and when do they end? When should I\nenter a market in which firms currently make high profits? What makes strategic\npartnerships work? These are just some examples of the questions we will\ndiscuss during the course, but by the end of the course you should be able to\napply the concepts to pretty much any business situation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>","subtitle_languages_csv":"","other_description":"","photo":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/c9/aaaec0f37fe9fa9f4cad54550fd8d2/tic_tac_toe_iStock_Natasha-Japp-Photography_webl.png","preview_link":null,"small_icon_hover":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/41/569c7574095ce7f5ec3b012380709f/tic_tac_toe_iStock_Natasha-Japp-Photography_webl.png","large_icon":"https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/ac/57b21e8a5cc489a45ebfc4200aaf1e/tic_tac_toe_iStock_Natasha-Japp-Photography_webl.png","video":"4nx2z0yX4so","university-ids":["lmu"],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/4nx2z0yX4so/","id":459,"universities":[{"rectangular_logo_svg":"","wordmark":null,"website_twitter":"","china_mirror":1,"favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/0e/9145506f8bafba7c4c29fdde573a60/Unbenannt-4.png","website_facebook":"","logo":"","background_color":"","id":64,"location_city":"M\u00fcnchen","location_country":"DE","location_lat":48.13660690000000000,"location":"Munich, Germany","primary_color":"#006633","abbr_name":"LMU Munich","website":"http://www.en.lmu.de/","description":"As one of Europe's leading research universities, LMU Munich is committed to the highest international standards of excellence in research and teaching.
